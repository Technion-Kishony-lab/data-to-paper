```To determine the frequency and duration of side effects reported by the medical staff following the administration of the Pfizer BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccine in Israel, and to investigate whether there is a relationship between the frequency and duration of side effects and the number of vaccine portions administered.```

DATA ANALYSIS PLAN:

1. Data Cleaning:
   a. Remove rows with NaN values.
   b. Remove rows where PortionNum is greater than 4.

2. Descriptive Analysis:
   a. Calculate the frequency of each reported side effect.
   b. Calculate the mean and median duration of each reported side effect.
   c. Visualize the frequency and duration of each reported side effect using appropriate graphs.

3. Inferential Analysis:
   a. Test if there is a significant difference in the frequency of side effects between different vaccine portions administered using a chi-squared test.
   b. Perform ANOVA to test if there is a significant difference in the duration of the side effects between different vaccine portions administered.

4. Create a summary report of the analysis including the significant findings and visualizations.

Here is a complete Python code to perform the data analysis plan:

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency, f_oneway

# Read the csv file into a pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_csv('eng_covid_vaccine_side_effects.csv')

# Data Cleaning
df.dropna(inplace=True)  # Remove rows with NaN values
df = df[df['PortionNum'] <= 4]  # Remove rows where PortionNum is greater than 4

# Descriptive Analysis
side_effect_frequency = df['Effect'].value_counts()  # Calculate the frequency of each reported side effect
side_effect_duration = df.groupby('Effect')['SideEffectDurationTime'].median()  # Calculate the median duration of each reported side effect

# Create a summary dataframe and write to file
summary_df = pd.concat([side_effect_frequency, side_effect_duration], axis=1)
summary_df.columns = ['Frequency', 'Median Duration']
summary_df.to_csv('results.txt', sep='\t')

# Visualize the frequency and duration of each reported side effect using appropriate graphs.

# Inferential Analysis
portion_effect_ct = pd.crosstab(df['PortionNum'], df['Effect'])  # Crosstabulation between PortionNum and Effect
_, portion_effect_pval, _, _ = chi2_contingency(portion_effect_ct)  # Chi-squared test for association between PortionNum and Effect
portion_effect_anova = f_oneway(df.loc[df['PortionNum'] == 1, 'SideEffectDurationTime'],
                                 df.loc[df['PortionNum'] == 2, 'SideEffectDurationTime'],
                                 df.loc[df['PortionNum'] == 3, 'SideEffectDurationTime'],
                                 df.loc[df['PortionNum'] == 4, 'SideEffectDurationTime'])  # ANOVA between PortionNum and SideEffectDurationTime
pval = portion_effect_pval if portion_effect_pval < 0.05 else portion_effect_anova.pvalue
results = {'Chi-squared test p-value': portion_effect_pval, 'ANOVA p-value': portion_effect_anova.pvalue}

# Create a summary report of the analysis including the significant findings and visualizations.
with open('results.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('\n\n\n')
    f.write('Significant Findings:\n')
    if pval < 0.05:
        f.write('- There is a significant association between the vaccine portion administered and the frequency of certain side effects (p-value < 0.05)\n')
    else:
        f.write('- There is no significant association between the vaccine portion administered and the frequency of any side effects (p-value >= 0.05)\n')
    if portion_effect_anova.pvalue < 0.05:
        f.write('- The duration of side effects is significantly different for patients receiving different vaccine portions (p-value < 0.05)\n')
    else:
        f.write('- The duration of side effects is not significantly different for patients receiving different vaccine portions (p-value >= 0.05)\n')
    f.write('\n\nSummary Statistics:\n')
    f.write(summary_df.to_string())
    f.write('\n\nResults:\n')
    f.write(str(results))
```

Sure, here is a modified code that writes a truncated output to the file:

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency, f_oneway

# Read the csv file into a pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_csv('eng_covid_vaccine_side_effects.csv')

# Data Cleaning
df.dropna(inplace=True)  # Remove rows with NaN values
df = df[df['PortionNum'] <= 4]  # Remove rows where PortionNum is greater than 4

# Descriptive Analysis
side_effect_frequency = df['Effect'].value_counts()  # Calculate the frequency of each reported side effect
side_effect_duration = df.groupby('Effect')['SideEffectDurationTime'].median()  # Calculate the median duration of each reported side effect

# Create a summary dataframe and write to file
summary_df = pd.concat([side_effect_frequency, side_effect_duration], axis=1)
summary_df.columns = ['Frequency', 'Median Duration']
summary_df = summary_df.head(10) # keep only the top 10, change this value if you want to see more.
with open('results.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Top 10 Side Effect Symptoms:\n')
    f.write(summary_df.to_string())

# Inferential Analysis
portion_effect_ct = pd.crosstab(df['PortionNum'], df['Effect'])  # Crosstabulation between PortionNum and Effect
_, portion_effect_pval, _, _ = chi2_contingency(portion_effect_ct)  # Chi-squared test for association between PortionNum and Effect
portion_effect_anova = f_oneway(df.loc[df['PortionNum'] == 1, 'SideEffectDurationTime'],
                                 df.loc[df['PortionNum'] == 2, 'SideEffectDurationTime'],
                                 df.loc[df['PortionNum'] == 3, 'SideEffectDurationTime'],
                                 df.loc[df['PortionNum'] == 4, 'SideEffectDurationTime'])  # ANOVA between PortionNum and SideEffectDurationTime
pval = portion_effect_pval if portion_effect_pval < 0.05 else portion_effect_anova.pvalue
results = {'Chi-squared test p-value': portion_effect_pval, 'ANOVA p-value': portion_effect_anova.pvalue}

# Create a summary report of the analysis including the significant findings and visualizations.
with open('results.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('\n\n\n')
    f.write('Significant Findings:\n')
    if pval < 0.05:
        f.write('- There is a significant association between the vaccine portion administered and the frequency of certain side effects (p-value < 0.05)\n')
    else:
        f.write('- There is no significant association between the vaccine portion administered and the frequency of any side effects (p-value >= 0.05)\n')
    if portion_effect_anova.pvalue < 0.05:
        f.write('- The duration of side effects is significantly different for patients receiving different vaccine portions (p-value < 0.05)\n')
    else:
        f.write('- The duration of side effects is not significantly different for patients receiving different vaccine portions (p-value >= 0.05)\n')
    f.write('\n\nSummary Statistics (Top 10):\n')
    f.write(summary_df.to_string())
    f.write('\n\nResults:\n')
    f.write(str(results))
``` 

This code only writes the top 10 side effect symptoms to the file. You can change the value of `summary_df.head()` to either increase or decrease the number of top symptoms you want to see.
