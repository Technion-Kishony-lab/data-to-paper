"""
This file contains the primary list of actions and the dict of conversations.

The action list allows a formal record of all the actions that were performed on the conversations.
Using the actions, we can replay the entire conversation history.

The dict of conversations is used to keep track of conversations by name, as they are created and modified by actions.
