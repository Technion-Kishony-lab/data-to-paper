\title{The Association between Lifestyle Factors and Self-reported Health Status in Individuals with and without Diabetes: A Logistic Regression Analysis}
\author{Data to Paper}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This study aimed to investigate differences in the association between lifestyle factors and self-reported health status in individuals with and without diabetes while controlling for age, sex, education, and income. The dataset included 253,680 health survey responses from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2015, comprising 35,314 individuals with diabetes and 218,366 without diabetes, with the prevalence of diabetes at 13.9\%. Self-reported health status was classified as good or bad based on the General Health survey item, with a threshold of 3, where scores below 3 were considered good and those equal to or above 3 were considered bad. Logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals with diabetes had significantly lower coefficients for physical activity than individuals without diabetes (\(\beta=-0.0603, p < 0.0001\)). Higher intake of fruit (\(\beta=-0.0596, p < 0.0004\)) and vegetables (\(\beta=-0.1133, p < 0.0001\)) were associated with better self-reported health status, but this association was weaker among individuals with diabetes than those without diabetes. Positive coefficients for heavy alcohol consumption were found among individuals with diabetes, but not among those without diabetes (\(\beta=0.1937, p < 0.0003\)). Smoking was associated with worse self-reported health status for both groups, but the association was stronger among individuals without diabetes (\(\beta=0.1042, p < 0.0001\)) than among those with diabetes (\(\beta=-0.2011, p < 0.0000\)). Age, sex, education, and income were included as control variables because they are known to influence self-reported health and may confound the relationship between lifestyle factors and health outcomes. Our findings suggest that maintaining a healthy lifestyle is important for individuals with diabetes to maintain good health. The identified disparities in the relationship between lifestyle and health across individuals with and without diabetes could inform targeted healthcare interventions to improve health outcomes.

\section{Introduction}

Diabetes is a major public health issue and its prevalence has been increasing worldwide in recent years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that over 30 million Americans, or nearly 1 in 10, have diabetes. Diabetes increases the risk of various health problems, including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, and blindness \cite{Dunlop2014How, Meitei2019Transition}. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and not smoking, is key to reducing the risk of these health problems. However, for individuals with diabetes, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is particularly crucial for optimal management of the disease and prevention of complications.

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual health-related telephone survey conducted by the CDC. The BRFSS collects data on various health-related behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventive services from over 400,000 Americans each year. The 2015 BRFSS dataset contains responses from over 250,000 individuals on various health indicators, among which 13.9\% have diabetes.

Several previous studies have investigated the relationship between lifestyle factors and health outcomes in individuals with and without diabetes \cite{Guo2008PDB59, Wilson2017Motivational, Rondhianto2023Foot, Sato2012Work-related}. Although some significant associations between lifestyle factors and health outcomes have been found, little is known about whether the strength of these associations differs across individuals with and without diabetes. Investigating these differences is important because it could help to identify lifestyle factors that are particularly important for maintaining good health in individuals with diabetes and to target health interventions more effectively \cite{Dickerson2010Associations}.

In this study, we aim to investigate the relationship between lifestyle factors and self-reported health status in individuals with and without diabetes and to examine whether this relationship differs between the two groups \cite{Dickerson2010Associations}. Additionally, we aim to control for potential confounding factors such as age, sex, education, and income. We hypothesize that the associations between lifestyle factors and self-reported health status will differ between individuals with and without diabetes \cite{Qin2019Exploring}. Our study's main contribution is identifying disparities in the relationship between lifestyle and health across individuals with and without diabetes, providing new insights into potential disparities in health outcomes, and informing targeted interventions to improve health outcomes \cite{Soares2018Association, Kim2018Association, Sebekova2017Vitamin}.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Dataset}
The dataset for this study was sourced from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 dataset, which comprises a set of 253,680 health survey responses. This representative sample of American adults includes 35,314 individuals diagnosed with diabetes and 218,366 without diabetes, representing a prevalence rate of 13.9\% for diabetes in the sample. The dataset captured 22 features covering health-related behaviors, chronic health conditions, and other demographic variables, such as age, gender, education, and income.

\subsection{Data Preparation}
For the purpose of the analysis, the dataset was preprocessed to convert self-reported health status from a continuous to a categorical variable. A good/bad threshold was set at a score of 3 on the `GenHlth` variable, which means that self-reported health status with scores below 3 were considered as good, while scores equal to or above 3 were considered as bad. We created a binary variable, `GoodHealth`, with a value of 1 representing good health and 0 representing bad health.

The explanatory variables used for the analysis were the five lifestyle factors captured in the dataset: `PhysActivity`, `Fruits`, `Veggies`, `HvyAlcoholConsump`, and `Smoker`. We also included the control variables `Age`, `Sex`, `Education`, and `Income`.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
To examine the association between lifestyle factors and self-reported health status in individuals with and without diabetes, we performed two sets of logistic regression analyses. The first considered a subsample of individuals with diabetes, and the second considered those without diabetes. We used the lifestyle factors and control variables as the independent variables in both logistic regression models to predict the binary `GoodHealth` outcome variable.

To ensure unbiased estimates, we used k-fold cross-validation (k=5) for the logistic regression, performed separately for the diabetes and non-diabetes groups. The dataset was divided into k equal-sized subsets, with one subset being used for validation and the remaining k-1 subsets for training. This process was iterated k times, each time using a different subset for validation. The coefficients obtained from the logistic regression analysis were then averaged across the k models.

\subsection{Statistical Comparison}
To compare the differences in the associations between the lifestyle factors and self-reported health status across individuals with and without diabetes, we calculated the differences in coefficients for each variable across the two models. We used the two-sample t-test to examine whether the differences in coefficients were statistically significant at a significance level of \(p<0.05\).



\section{Results}

The dataset included 253,680 health survey responses from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2015, comprising 35,314 individuals with diabetes and 218,366 without diabetes, with the prevalence of diabetes at 13.9\%. The mean Diabetes\_binary (prevalence of diabetes) was 0.139. Self-reported health status was classified as good or bad based on the General Health survey item, with a threshold of 3, where scores below 3 were considered good and those equal to or above 3 were considered bad.

Table \ref{tab:table1} shows the differences in logistic regression coefficients of lifestyle factors and self-reported health status between individuals with and without diabetes. The coefficients were estimated while controlling for age, sex, education, and income. Mean\_Diabetes and Mean\_No\_Diabetes columns represent the mean value of each variable within each diabetes group. Individuals with diabetes had significantly lower coefficients for physical activity in MET-minutes/week than individuals without diabetes (\(\beta=-0.0603, p < 0.0001\)). Higher intake of fruit (servings per day) (\(\beta=-0.0596, p < 0.0004\)) and vegetables (servings per day) (\(\beta=-0.1133, p < 0.0001\)) were associated with better self-reported health status, but this association was weaker among individuals with diabetes than those without diabetes. Positive coefficients for heavy alcohol consumption (defined as having at least one heavy drinking episode in the past month) were found among individuals with diabetes, but not among those without diabetes (\(\beta=0.1937, p < 0.0003\)). Smoking was associated with worse self-reported health status for both groups, but the association was stronger among individuals without diabetes (\(\beta=0.1042, p < 0.0001\)) than among those with diabetes (\(\beta=-0.2011, p < 0.0000\)).\begin{table}[h!]

These results indicate that maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity, a balanced diet with high intake of fruits and vegetables, abstaining from smoking, and moderate alcohol consumption, is important for individuals with diabetes to maintain good health. The identified disparities in the relationship between lifestyle and health across individuals with and without diabetes could inform targeted healthcare interventions to improve health outcomes. Possible interventions could include providing education on healthy lifestyle choices tailored to the specific needs of individuals with diabetes or improving access to resources such as healthy food options and affordable physical activity programs.

\section{Discussion}

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between lifestyle factors and self-reported health status in individuals with and without diabetes while controlling for age, sex, education, and income. The findings suggest that regular physical activity, a balanced diet with high intake of fruits and vegetables, abstaining from smoking, and moderate alcohol consumption are associated with better self-reported health status in both individuals with and without diabetes \cite{Whiting2022Variations, Soares2018Association, Halliday2016Earnings}., which is consistent with previous research in this area.

The study revealed disparities in the relationship between lifestyle and health across individuals with and without diabetes \cite{Gorber2009The}.. Individuals with diabetes had significantly lower coefficients for physical activity than individuals without diabetes \cite{Jack2005Beyond}.. The association between high intake of fruits and vegetables and better self-reported health was weaker among individuals with diabetes than among those without diabetes \cite{Shiue2015Age}.. The positive association between heavy alcohol consumption and self-reported health was found only among individuals with diabetes \cite{Grandy2008EQ-5D}.

\section{Conclusion}

This study investigated the relationship between lifestyle factors and self-reported health status in individuals with and without diabetes. The results indicate that maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity, a balanced diet with high intake of fruits and vegetables, abstaining from smoking, and moderate alcohol consumption, is important for individuals with and without diabetes to maintain good health.

The study revealed disparities in the relationship between lifestyle and health across individuals with and without diabetes. Individuals with diabetes had significantly lower coefficients for physical activity than individuals without diabetes. The association between high intake of fruits and vegetables and better self-reported health was weaker among individuals with diabetes than among those without diabetes. The positive association between heavy alcohol consumption and self-reported health was found only among individuals with diabetes.

These findings have important implications for healthcare interventions aimed at improving health outcomes for individuals with diabetes. Possible interventions could include providing education on healthy lifestyle choices tailored to the specific needs of individuals with diabetes or improving access to resources such as healthy food options and affordable physical activity programs. Future research could also investigate other lifestyle factors, such as stress and sleep, in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to good health in individuals with and without diabetes.

\subsection{Code Description}

The code performs a comparative analysis of the relationship between lifestyle factors and self-reported health status among individuals with and without diabetes, while controlling for age, sex, education, and income. We first preprocess the dataset, transforming the self-reported health status into a binary variable indicating 'Good Health' or 'Bad Health' based on a threshold value. The analysis focuses on the following lifestyle factors: physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, heavy alcohol consumption, and smoking.

Using a logistic regression approach, we separately analyze the associations between lifestyle factors and self-reported health status for individuals with and without diabetes. To ensure robustness of our findings, we employ a k-fold cross-validation technique, where the data is divided into k non-overlapping partitions. The logistic regression model is then trained and tested using these partitions iteratively, with each partition used as a validation set once. This procedure is carried out for both the diabetes and non-diabetes groups.

After obtaining the logistic regression coefficients for both groups, we compute coefficient differences and conduct one-sample t-tests for each variable to determine whether there are statistically significant differences in coefficients between the diabetes and non-diabetes groups. This allows us to evaluate the disparities in the relationship between lifestyle factors and self-reported health status for individuals with and without diabetes.

The resulting comparisons, mean values of each logistic regression coefficient, coefficient differences, and p-values are written to the "results.txt" file. The output file is organized into a table-format that allows for easy interpretation of results and to facilitate reporting in a scientific paper.
