    "Here is a short data analysis plan for testing the gender bias in birth records:\n\n```\n1. Calculate the total number of births in the dataset.\n\n2. Calculate the number of male and female births separately.\n\n3. Calculate the proportion of male and female births by dividing the number of male/female births with the total number of births.\n\n4. Conduct a hypothesis test, using a two-proportion z-test, to determine if there is a significant difference in the proportion of male and female births. \n\n5. Set up the null hypothesis (H0) as the proportion of male births being equal to the proportion of female births. The alternative hypothesis (H1) would be that the proportion of male births is significantly different from the proportion of female births.\n\n6. Calculate the z-score using the formula and the values obtained in step 3. \n\n7. Determine the p-value associated with the calculated z-score.\n\n8. Determine the level of significance. Typically, a level of significance of alpha = 0.05 is used.\n\n9. Compare the p-value with the level of significance. If the p-value is less than the level of significance, then reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the proportion of male and female births. If the p-value is greater than the level of significance, then fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is not enough evidence to suggest a significant difference in the proportion of male and female births.\n\n10. Report the result with the conclusion of the hypothesis test.\n```\n",
