            "abstract": "As the COVID19 spread in the US continues to grow, local and state officials face difficult decisions about when and how to transition to a new normal. We developed an agent-based simulation model to project the infection spread; outcomes include the number of COVID19 infections and resulting severe outcomes, and the need for hospital capacity under social distancing, particularly, shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine. We populated the model using COVID19-specific parameters for the natural history of the disease and data from Georgia on the agents interactions and demographics. The simulation study covered a six-month period, testing different social distancing scenarios, including baselines (no-intervention or school closure only) and combinations of shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine with different timelines and compliance levels. The outcomes are compared at the state and community levels. Main outcomes are the number and percentage of cumulative and daily new and symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths; COVID19-related demand for hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. Results: The combined intervention of shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine reduced peak infections from 180,000 under no intervention and 120,000 under school closure, respectively, to below 80,000, and delayed the peak from April to June or later. Increasing shelter-in-place duration from four to five weeks yielded 3-14% and 4-6% decrease in cumulative infection and fatality rates, respectively. Regardless of the shelter-in-place duration, increasing voluntary quarantine compliance decreased daily new infections from almost 80,000 to 50,000, and decreased cumulative infection rate by 50%. The total number of fatalities ranged from 6,150 to 17,900 under different scenarios. Peak infection date varied across scenarios and counties; on average, increasing shelter-in-place duration delayed the peak day by 7 days across counties. The peak percentage is similar across rural and urban counties. Region D is estimated to have the highest COVID19-related healthcare needs with 7,357 hospital beds, 1,141 ICU beds, and 558 ventilators. Conclusions and Relevance Shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine substantially reduce COVID19 infections, healthcare resource needs, and severe outcomes; delay the peak; and enable better preparedness. Time of the peak is projected to vary across locations, enabling reallocation of health system capacity.",

            "abstract": "Efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have relied heavily on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including physical distancing, hand hygiene, and mask-wearing. However, an effective vaccine is essential to containing the spread of the virus. The first doses were distributed at the end of 2020, but the efficacy, period of immunity it will provide, and percentage of coverage still remain unclear. We developed a compartment model to examine different vaccine strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Our framework accounts for testing rates, test-turnaround times, and vaccination waning immunity. Using reported case data from the city of Toronto, Canada between Mar-Dec, 2020 we defined epidemic phases of infection using contact rates, which depend on individuals duration of time spent within the household, workplace/school, or community settings, as well as the probability of transmission upon contact. We investigated the impact of vaccine distribution by comparing different permutations of waning immunity, vaccine coverage and efficacy throughout various stages of NPIs relaxation in terms of cases, deaths, and household transmission, as measured using the basic reproduction number (R0). We observed that widespread vaccine coverage substantially reduced the number of cases and deaths. In order for NPIs to be relaxed 8 months after vaccine distribution, infection spread can be kept under control with either 60% vaccine coverage, no waning immunity, and 70% efficacy, or with 60% coverage with a 12-month waning immunity and 90% vaccine efficacy. Widespread virus resurgence can result when the immunity wanes under 3 months and/or when NPIs are relaxed in concomitance with vaccine distribution. In addition to vaccination, our analysis of R0 showed that the basic reproduction number is reduced by decreasing the tests turnaround time and transmission in the household. While we found that household transmission can decrease following the introduction of a vaccine, public health efforts to reduce test turnaround times remain important for virus containment. Our findings suggest that vaccinating two-thirds of the population with a vaccine that is at least 70% effective may be sufficient for controlling COVID-19 spread, as long as NPIs are not immediately relaxed.",

Apart from the vaccine, the only cure for this drastic disease is to follow the rules and regulations that avoid further spread. There are different mechanisms like (Social Distancing, Mask Detection, Human occupancy etc.) through which we can able to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In this paper, we proposed hotspot zone detection using the computer vision techniques of deep learning. We have defined the hotspot area as the particular region on which the person touches more than some specified threshold. We further mark that area to some specific color to help the authority take necessary action and disinfect that particular place. To implement this algorithm, we have utilized the human-object interaction concept. We have extracted the dataset of person classes from the publicly available dataset for the person detection and the self-generated dataset to train the algorithm. Different experiments on object detection algorithms (YOLO-v3, Faster RCNN, SSD) for person detection have been performed in this work. We achieved the maximum accuracy in real-time on the YOLO-v3 for person detection. Whereas we have marked the specific area using the template matching algorithm of computer vision techniques. Our proposed algorithm detects the persons and extracts the region of interest points on which the user draws the rectangle. Then we find the intersection over union ratio between the detected person and the region of interest of the marked area to make the decision. We have achieved 88.72% accuracy on person detection in the local environment. Whereas, for the whole system of human-object interaction for detecting the hotspot area zone, we have achieved 86.7% accuracy using the confusion matrix.",

Workers voluntarily underwent serological testing before vaccination (T1), at least 15 days after vaccination (T2), and at least 150 days after vaccination (T3). We picked individuals who had received two doses of the vaccine. As for positivity, we assessed incidence \u2013 and therefore symptomatology \u2013 in three time intervals. We used a contingency tables for the analysis and tested the relation to the chi-square test and ANOVA test. Regarding differentials in terms of antibody capacity, we considered different time intervals: the methodological approach was the same.\n\nResults\nThe average value of the dimeric serological testing at T1 was equal to 28.80 AU/mL, which increased to 220.55 AU/mL at T2, and then decreased to 143.62 AU/mL at T3 (P = 0.000). At T2, the number of people with a protective titer was equal to 95.96% of the total; at T3, it was equal to 96.39% (P = 0.019). Before the vaccination campaign, 75 workers tested positive (25 paucisymptoms, 4 severe symptoms). After vaccination, 14 workers tested positive: almost all were asymptomatic.\n\nConclusion\nVaccination determines a statistically significant variation of the average value of antibody titer, a statistically significant reduction of positive swab tests and a better prognosis.",

Sisonke 2 enrolled 227 310 HCW from the 8 November to the 17 December 2021.

We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine booster in 69 092 HCW as compared to unvaccinated individuals enrolled in the same managed care organization using a test negative design. We compared VE against COVID19 admission for omicron during the period 15 November to 20 December 2021. After adjusting for confounders, we observed that VE for hospitalisation increased over time since booster dose, from 63% (95%CI 31-81%); to 84% (95% CI 67-92%) and then 85% (95% CI: 54-95%), 0-13 days, 14-27 days, and 1-2 months post-boost. We provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of a homologous Ad26.COV.2 vaccine boost given 6-9 months after the initial single vaccination series during a period of omicron variant circulation.

The COVID19 pandemic has presented new challenges to healthcare infrastructure, virology, vaccinology research, and implementation science. Misinformation concerning vaccines and nonpharmacologic measures to mitigate the spread of COVID19 has made the study of vaccine efficacy extremely important for both transparency and accountability. The vaccines for COVID19 were developed with urgency but without compromise of any safety or regulatory measures. They are undoubtedly the most efficacious means of disease mitigation we currently have available. As of this writing, 11.7 billion doses have been given worldwide, with 578 million in the USA alone. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the coronavirus, new variants continue to emerge. When dealing with a rapidly changing pathogen, it is essential to continuously review and update the known data, as manuscripts become outdated as soon as the first draft is written. In this issue of Journal of Investigative Medicine, Hirsh et al reviewed the breakthrough COVID19 infections in vaccination but emphasize the overwhelming effectiveness of the vaccines overall. The article cites the known efficacy of the mRNA vaccines as 95% against symptomatic infection in initial studies. Even with the advent of newer variants and their increased immune evasion, severe infections, hospitalization, and death are still much more common in the unvaccinated compared with the vaccinated population; however, this effect is diminished in the vaccinated cohort who are immunocompromised or more elderly. During the Delta and subsequent Omicron surges, this predominance of severe disease among the unvaccinated was repeatedly illustrated by the published illustrations from numerous hospitals showing the disproportionate number of unvaccinated patients admitted to the COVID19 wards, critical care units, and on the ventilators. The other benefits of vaccination, such as reduction in detectable viral load and reduction in contagious period, are more difficult to measure on a populationwide level. Even as we write, the current variants of concern in the USA now include BA.2, which is quickly being outcompeted by BA.2.12.1. Meanwhile, the WHO is tracking the rapid spread of BA.4 and BA.5 internationally, as well as its recent arrival in the USA. With each variant, the performance of the vaccination or native immunity is again called into question. Ongoing studies report that vaccine efficacy against the Omicron variant is maintained against severe disease, although to a lesser extent for symptomatic disease and infection among both mRNA and inactivated vaccines. However, these benefits are highly dependent on receipt of booster doses as well as time from vaccination. There remains no consensus on the frequency or number of booster doses that will ultimately be required as these new variants appear. Recent data also suggest that fourth vaccine doses in the general population again offer improved protection against infection and severe disease compared with three doses. The issue of the waning immunity of the population, especially at the extremes of age, and the issue of vaccine availability to the very young or the disadvantaged continue to require further investigation and appropriate action. The United Nations estimates that only 1% of COVID19 vaccines administered worldwide have been in developing countries. This has farreaching repercussions; the generation of variants, like in the mutation of the wellknown pandemic virus, HIV, is directly related to the amount of uncontrolled viral replication that is allowed. More unvaccinated cohorts will allow the virus to replicate freely and increase the odds of forming new and potentially more virulent variants. This makes the issues of expanding availability and eligibility for vaccination of paramount importance. Humanity has been fortunate with maintained vaccine efficacy; although as a result, the other nonpharmacologic interventions to prevent COVID19 spread have been dropped as the public perception of risk has decreased. This only increases the need for continued timely, quality, peerreviewed data on which to base future public health decisionmaking. Whether there may yet be a variant which escapes the vaccine\u2019s curated antibodies and adversely impacts that risk calculation\u2014only time will tell.",

Workers voluntarily underwent serological testing before vaccination (T1), at least 15 days after vaccination (T2), and at least 150 days after vaccination (T3). We picked individuals who had received two doses of the vaccine. As for positivity, we assessed incidence \u2013 and therefore symptomatology \u2013 in three time intervals. We used a contingency tables for the analysis and tested the relation to the chi-square test and ANOVA test. Regarding differentials in terms of antibody capacity, we considered different time intervals: the methodological approach was the same.\n\nResults\nThe average value of the dimeric serological testing at T1 was equal to 28.80 AU/mL, which increased to 220.55 AU/mL at T2, and then decreased to 143.62 AU/mL at T3 (P = 0.000). At T2, the number of people with a protective titer was equal to 95.96% of the total; at T3, it was equal to 96.39% (P = 0.019). Before the vaccination campaign, 75 workers tested positive (25 paucisymptoms, 4 severe symptoms). After vaccination, 14 workers tested positive: almost all were asymptomatic.\n\nConclusion\nVaccination determines a statistically significant variation of the average value of antibody titer, a statistically significant reduction of positive swab tests and a better prognosis.",

However, an effective vaccine is essential to containing the spread of the virus. The first doses were distributed at the end of 2020, but the efficacy, period of immunity it will provide, and percentage of coverage still remain unclear. We developed a compartment model to examine different vaccine strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Our framework accounts for testing rates, test-turnaround times, and vaccination waning immunity. Using reported case data from the city of Toronto, Canada between Mar-Dec, 2020 we defined epidemic phases of infection using contact rates, which depend on individuals duration of time spent within the household, workplace/school, or community settings, as well as the probability of transmission upon contact. We investigated the impact of vaccine distribution by comparing different permutations of waning immunity, vaccine coverage and efficacy throughout various stages of NPIs relaxation in terms of cases, deaths, and household transmission, as measured using the basic reproduction number (R0). We observed that widespread vaccine coverage substantially reduced the number of cases and deaths. In order for NPIs to be relaxed 8 months after vaccine distribution, infection spread can be kept under control with either 60% vaccine coverage, no waning immunity, and 70% efficacy, or with 60% coverage with a 12-month waning immunity and 90% vaccine efficacy. Widespread virus resurgence can result when the immunity wanes under 3 months and/or when NPIs are relaxed in concomitance with vaccine distribution. In addition to vaccination, our analysis of R0 showed that the basic reproduction number is reduced by decreasing the tests turnaround time and transmission in the household. While we found that household transmission can decrease following the introduction of a vaccine, public health efforts to reduce test turnaround times remain important for virus containment. Our findings suggest that vaccinating two-thirds of the population with a vaccine that is at least 70% effective may be sufficient for controlling COVID-19 spread, as long as NPIs are not immediately relaxed.",

            "abstract": "Introduction Pfizer-BioNTech collaboration started in 2018 in order to develop mRNA flu vaccine. Because of the covid19 pandemic the two companies started to focus on mRNA vaccine development for the prevention of covid19 infection. In March they signed the Letters of Intent. Initially there were four vaccine candidates including unmodified mRNA, nucleoside-modified mRNA and self-amplifying mRNA. For further development the nucleoside- modified mRNA was chosen. In April Phase 1/2 study was completed in Germany and in May in the USA. Two 30 \u03bcg doses 3 weeks apart induced neutralizing antibody titers comparable to natural infection and strong CD4+ and CD8+ Tcell responses were observed. Phase 2b/3 clinical trial started in July involving more than 43.000 participants in 153 sites. The result showed 95% efficacy with mild and moderate local and systemic events. For safety reason all participants will be followed for 2 years after the second dose. Based on rolling review regulatory agencies were able to approve within a short period of time in December 2020, first MHRA in UK, then FDA authorized for Emergency Use and EMA granted Conditional Marketing Authorization on 21 December 2021 for 16 years old and older. The first shipments were sent all European countries on 27 December. Direct shipments to vaccination centers on ultra-low temperature (minus 9060 degree of centigrade) using dry ice. Each thermal shipping container has a temperature monitoring device. All shipments are tracked via GPS monitoring device to ensure end-to-end distribution within required temperatures. In May EMA granted an extension of indication for covid-19 vaccine to include in children aged 12-15. The effect of vaccine was investigated in 2260 children aged 12-15, about half of them received dummy injection. Of the 1,005 children receiving the vaccine, none developed COVID-19 compared to 16 children out of the 978 who received the dummy injection. This means that, in this study, the vaccine was 100% effective at preventing COVID-19. The most common side effects in children aged 12 to 15 are similar like those in people aged 16 and above. They include pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. These effects are usually mild or moderate and improve within a few days from the vaccination. EMA granted approval for booster dose (third dose) for immune weakened people 28 days after the second dose, and 6 months after the second dose for 18 years of age and older. Approval is based on the clinical program evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a booster dose of covid-19 vaccine. A booster dose of the vaccine elicited significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against the initial SARS-CoV-2 virus (wild type), as well as the Beta and Delta variants, when compared with the levels observed after the two-dose primary series. The reactogenicity profile within seven days after the booster dose was typically mild to moderate, and the frequency of reactions was similar to or lower than after dose two. The efficacy is this trial was 95,6%. In October 2021 FDA authorized for emergency use of covid-19 for children 5 through 111 years of age. For this age group, the vaccine is to be admin-istered in a two-dose regimen of 10 \u03bcg (0,2 ml) doses given 21 days apart. EUA is supported by clinical data showing a favorable safety profile and high vaccine efficacy of 90.7% in children 5 through 11 years of age during a period when Delta was the prevalent strain. In 2021 we have already distributed 1,8B doses to 146 countries by end of September. In 2022 we plan to distribute 4B doses. (Figure Presented).",

            "abstract": "Organizations are struggling to ensure business continuity without compromising on delivery excellence in the face of Covid19 pandemic related uncertainties. The uncertainty exists along multiple dimensions such as virus mutations, infectivity and severity of new mutants, efficacy of vaccines against new mutants, waning of vaccine induced immunity over time, and lockdown / opening-up policies effected by city authorities. Moreover, this uncertainty plays out in a non-uniform manner across nations, states, cities, and even within the cities thus leading to highly heterogeneous evolution of pandemic. While Work From Home (WFH) strategy has served well to meet ever-increasing business demands without compromising on individual health safety, there has been an undeniable reduction in social capital. With Covid19 pandemic showing definite waning trends, organizations are considering the possibility of safe transition from WFH to Work From Office (WFO) or a hybrid mode of operation. An effective strategy needs to score equally well on possibly interfering dimensions such as risk of infection, project delivery, and employee wellness. As large organizations will typically have a large number of offices spread across a geography, the problem of arriving at office-specific strategies becomes non-trivial. Moreover, the strategies need to adapt over time to changes that cannot be deduced upfront. This calls for an approach that is amenable to quick and easy adaptation. Our contribution in this regard is constructing a Digital Twin by leveraging various modelling techniques to realistically represent the above mentioned aspects of interest that can be subjected to what-if scenario analysis. We further demonstrate its efficacy using a case study from a large organization.",

            "abstract": "Almost 2 years into the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the number of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), morbidity, and mortality are still increasing. In spite of the considerable progress in the development of the COVID-19 vaccines, adequate vaccination coverage has not been achieved even in the most developed countries, and a significant gap still exists among high-, middle-, and low-income countries. While vaccination plays a central role in controlling COVID-19\u2019s spread, some concerns remain surrounding the emergence of resistance of new variants against available vaccines and their waning of efficacy over time. The assessment of the neutralization efficiency of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine against different variants showed that neutralization against the omicron variant is lower compared with the previous variants of concern, even after the third dose of vaccine. Accordingly, evaluation of the effectiveness of 2 doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or ChAdOx1 nCoV19 (AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccines showed limited protection against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron variant. Notably, a booster dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) after primary immunization led to considerably improved protection against the omicron variant; however, the protection waned notably during the time.1\u20133 While it is clear that vaccination is the most effective tool for control of the pandemic, other important tools include anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antiviral medications that are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Objectives\nOur study aims to determine the trend of the antibody titer and assess the efficacy of the vaccine.\n\nMethods\nIt was conducted on 983 healthcare professionals between 27 February 2020 and 22 October 2021 at the Local Health Authority (ASL) of Rieti. Workers voluntarily underwent serological testing before vaccination (T1), at least 15 days after vaccination (T2), and at least 150 days after vaccination (T3). We picked individuals who had received two doses of the vaccine. As for positivity, we assessed incidence \u2013 and therefore symptomatology \u2013 in three time intervals. We used a contingency tables for the analysis and tested the relation to the chi-square test and ANOVA test. Regarding differentials in terms of antibody capacity, we considered different time intervals: the methodological approach was the same.\n\nResults\nThe average value of the dimeric serological testing at T1 was equal to 28.80 AU/mL, which increased to 220.55 AU/mL at T2, and then decreased to 143.62 AU/mL at T3 (P = 0.000). At T2, the number of people with a protective titer was equal to 95.96% of the total; at T3, it was equal to 96.39% (P = 0.019). Before the vaccination campaign, 75 workers tested positive (25 paucisymptoms, 4 severe symptoms). After vaccination, 14 workers tested positive: almost all were asymptomatic.\n\nConclusion\nVaccination determines a statistically significant variation of the average value of antibody titer, a statistically significant reduction of positive swab tests and a better prognosis.",
