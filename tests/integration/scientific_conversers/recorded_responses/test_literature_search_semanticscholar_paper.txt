            "abstract": "As the COVID19 spread in the US continues to grow, local and state officials face difficult decisions about when and how to transition to a new normal. We developed an agent-based simulation model to project the infection spread; outcomes include the number of COVID19 infections and resulting severe outcomes, and the need for hospital capacity under social distancing, particularly, shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine. We populated the model using COVID19-specific parameters for the natural history of the disease and data from Georgia on the agents interactions and demographics. The simulation study covered a six-month period, testing different social distancing scenarios, including baselines (no-intervention or school closure only) and combinations of shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine with different timelines and compliance levels. The outcomes are compared at the state and community levels. Main outcomes are the number and percentage of cumulative and daily new and symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths; COVID19-related demand for hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. Results: The combined intervention of shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine reduced peak infections from 180,000 under no intervention and 120,000 under school closure, respectively, to below 80,000, and delayed the peak from April to June or later. Increasing shelter-in-place duration from four to five weeks yielded 3-14% and 4-6% decrease in cumulative infection and fatality rates, respectively. Regardless of the shelter-in-place duration, increasing voluntary quarantine compliance decreased daily new infections from almost 80,000 to 50,000, and decreased cumulative infection rate by 50%. The total number of fatalities ranged from 6,150 to 17,900 under different scenarios. Peak infection date varied across scenarios and counties; on average, increasing shelter-in-place duration delayed the peak day by 7 days across counties. The peak percentage is similar across rural and urban counties. Region D is estimated to have the highest COVID19-related healthcare needs with 7,357 hospital beds, 1,141 ICU beds, and 558 ventilators. Conclusions and Relevance Shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine substantially reduce COVID19 infections, healthcare resource needs, and severe outcomes; delay the peak; and enable better preparedness. Time of the peak is projected to vary across locations, enabling reallocation of health system capacity.",

            "abstract": "Efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have relied heavily on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including physical distancing, hand hygiene, and mask-wearing. However, an effective vaccine is essential to containing the spread of the virus. The first doses were distributed at the end of 2020, but the efficacy, period of immunity it will provide, and percentage of coverage still remain unclear. We developed a compartment model to examine different vaccine strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Our framework accounts for testing rates, test-turnaround times, and vaccination waning immunity. Using reported case data from the city of Toronto, Canada between Mar-Dec, 2020 we defined epidemic phases of infection using contact rates, which depend on individuals duration of time spent within the household, workplace/school, or community settings, as well as the probability of transmission upon contact. We investigated the impact of vaccine distribution by comparing different permutations of waning immunity, vaccine coverage and efficacy throughout various stages of NPIs relaxation in terms of cases, deaths, and household transmission, as measured using the basic reproduction number (R0). We observed that widespread vaccine coverage substantially reduced the number of cases and deaths. In order for NPIs to be relaxed 8 months after vaccine distribution, infection spread can be kept under control with either 60% vaccine coverage, no waning immunity, and 70% efficacy, or with 60% coverage with a 12-month waning immunity and 90% vaccine efficacy. Widespread virus resurgence can result when the immunity wanes under 3 months and/or when NPIs are relaxed in concomitance with vaccine distribution. In addition to vaccination, our analysis of R0 showed that the basic reproduction number is reduced by decreasing the tests turnaround time and transmission in the household. While we found that household transmission can decrease following the introduction of a vaccine, public health efforts to reduce test turnaround times remain important for virus containment. Our findings suggest that vaccinating two-thirds of the population with a vaccine that is at least 70% effective may be sufficient for controlling COVID-19 spread, as long as NPIs are not immediately relaxed.",

Apart from the vaccine, the only cure for this drastic disease is to follow the rules and regulations that avoid further spread. There are different mechanisms like (Social Distancing, Mask Detection, Human occupancy etc.) through which we can able to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In this paper, we proposed hotspot zone detection using the computer vision techniques of deep learning. We have defined the hotspot area as the particular region on which the person touches more than some specified threshold. We further mark that area to some specific color to help the authority take necessary action and disinfect that particular place. To implement this algorithm, we have utilized the human-object interaction concept. We have extracted the dataset of person classes from the publicly available dataset for the person detection and the self-generated dataset to train the algorithm. Different experiments on object detection algorithms (YOLO-v3, Faster RCNN, SSD) for person detection have been performed in this work. We achieved the maximum accuracy in real-time on the YOLO-v3 for person detection. Whereas we have marked the specific area using the template matching algorithm of computer vision techniques. Our proposed algorithm detects the persons and extracts the region of interest points on which the user draws the rectangle. Then we find the intersection over union ratio between the detected person and the region of interest of the marked area to make the decision. We have achieved 88.72% accuracy on person detection in the local environment. Whereas, for the whole system of human-object interaction for detecting the hotspot area zone, we have achieved 86.7% accuracy using the confusion matrix.",

The temporal dynamics of viral load and test false negative rate have the potential to alter the apparent efficacy of testing, as testing must identify a sick individual prior to that person transmitting the virus to one or more people and isolate them. High levels of pre-symptomatic spread and high false negative rates for testing would therefore be likely to make it difficult to successfully test an individual in the time frame necessary to stop viral spread. Here, we develop a stochastic agent-based model of COVID19 in a university sized population, considering the dynamics of both viral load and false negative rate of tests on the ability of testing to combat viral spread. We find that the undetectable period of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to an apparent false negative rate of ~17% in the presence of a hypothetical perfect test, while full implementation of dynamic false negative rates reported in the literature leads to an overall false negative rate of ~48%. We then compare testing while varying fraction of the population and the frequency of testing. We find that these assumptions about viral load and false negative rate lead to a requirement for high levels of both frequency and fraction of population tested in order to bring the apparent R0 below 1. We conclude that models that do not consider the non-uniform dynamics of viral spread and false negative rate may come up with unrealistic testing plans that will not lead to the desired reduction in apparent R0.",

In the United States, strict social distancing has resulted in different types infection dynamics. In some states, such as New York, extensive infection spread was followed by a pronounced decline of infection levels. In other states, such as California, less infection spread occurred before strict social distancing, and a different pattern was observed. Instead of a pronounced infection decline, a long-lasting plateau is evident, characterized by similar daily new infection levels. While these plateau dynamics cannot be readily reproduced with standard SIR infection models, we show that network models, in which individuals and their social contacts are explicitly tracked, can reproduce the plateau if network connections are cut due to social distancing measures. The reason is that in networks characterized by a degree of 2D spatial structure, infection tends to spread quadratically with time, but as edges are randomly removed, the infection spreads along nearly one-dimensional infection \"corridors\", resulting in plateau dynamics. Interestingly, the plateau dynamics are predicted to eventually transition into an infection decline phase without any further increase in social distancing measures. Additionally, the models suggest that a potential second wave becomes significantly less pronounced if social distancing is only relaxed once the dynamics have transitioned to the decline phase. The network models analyzed here allow us to interpret and reconcile different infection dynamics during social distancing observed in various US states.",

            "abstract": "A correlation exists between observed spread of COVID 19, (SARS-CoV-2), and climatological temperatures and latitude. Along an observed area of 25-55 degrees North latitude and within a climatological band of 4-12 degrees centigrade, enhanced spread of the disease has been observed between December and February 2019-2020. Additionally, a comparison of the seasonality of other viruses, like seasonal Influenza, shows that the cool season in the northern hemisphere (Boreal Winter) favors spread of the diseases more than the warm season in the northern hemisphere (Boreal Summer). Further, examining locations where spread would be expected for COVID-19 based on a travel and population density model does not account for the observed trends with some high population and high travel areas seeing little if any community spread of the virus if that location falls outside of the climatologically favored zones. Mapping was created using these principles beginning in mid-February and has shown skill in predicting where the virus would be most likely to spread. While correlation exists between temperature profiles and the spread of the disease, a causative element associated with viral kinetics of Covid-19 may be related in parallel. Given research data confirming that the virus did not become quickly deactivated in temperatures ranges outside of the observed preferred environmental thermal profile (4-12 C), it is possible that the atmospheric radiation that is the primary differentiator between seasonal temperature variation is also the primary cause of apparent seasonal variation in COVID-19. Additional laboratory research is required to establish environmental Ultra-Violet (UV) radiation within the UVA and UVB spectrums as effective germicides. Given that UV (and in general all insolation) is modulated heavily by weather like humidity and cloud cover, by utilizing deterministic atmospheric weather modeling and an understood seasonality of COVID-19, it may therefore be possible to create a forecast that has skill and can be used by governing bodies at varying levels as well as health care coordinators to better utilize resources to prepare for, mitigate against, respond to, and recover from a potential viral pandemic. Additionally, it is possible that the viral kinetics studied may be generalized to predict outbreaks of varying viral origins in the future.",

In this brief, the relevant emerging dynamics are further investigated. Evidence that this nonlinear model demonstrates critical dynamics is scrutinized within the frame of the physics of critical phenomena. Additionally, the concept of criticality over the infected population fraction in epidemics (or a pandemic) is introduced and its importance is discussed, highlighting the emergence of the critical slowdown phenomenon. A simple method is proposed for estimating how far away a population is from this \"singular\" state, by utilizing the theory of critical phenomena. Finally, a dynamic approach applying the self-organized diffusion model is proposed, resulting in more accurate simulations, which can verify the effectiveness of restrictive measures. All the above are supported by real epidemic data case studies.",

            "abstract": "We have analyzed the COVID19 epidemic data of more than 174 countries (excluding China) in the period between January 22 and March 28, 2020. We found that some countries (such as the US, the UK, and Canada) follow an exponential epidemic growth, while others (like Italy and several other European countries) show a power law like growth. At the same time, regardless of the best fitting law, most countries can be shown to follow a trajectory similar to that of Italy, but with varying degrees of delay. We found that countries with ``younger\" epidemics tend to exhibit more exponential like behavior, while countries that are closer behind Italy tend to follow a power law growth. We hypothesize that there is a universal growth pattern of this infection that starts off as exponential and subsequently becomes more power law like. Although it cannot be excluded that this growth pattern is a consequence of social distancing measures, an alternative explanation is that it is an intrinsic epidemic growth law, dictated by a spatially distributed community structure, where the growth in individual highly mixed communities is exponential but the longer term, local geographical spread (in the absence of global mixing) results in a power-law. This is supported by computer simulations of a metapopulation model that gives rise to predictions about the growth dynamics that are consistent with correlations found in the epidemiological data. Therefore, seeing a deviation from straight exponential growth may not be a consequence of working non-pharmaceutical interventions (except for, perhaps, restricting the air travel). Instead, this is a normal course of raging infection spread. On the practical side, this cautions us against overly optimistic interpretations of the countries epidemic development and emphasizes the need to continue improving the compliance with social distancing behavior recommendations.",

Moreover, we illustrate possible future scenarios, associated to different intervals of $R_0$. This model has been used since the beginning of March 2020, predicting the Italian peak of the epidemic in April 2020 with about 100.000 detected active cases. The real peak of the epidemic happened on the 20th of April 2020, with 108.000 active cases. This result shows that the model had predictive power for the italian case.",

            "abstract": "We model the evolution of the number of individuals that are reported to be sick with COVID-19 in Germany. Our theoretical framework builds on a continuous time Markov chain with four states: healthy without infection, sick, healthy after recovery or after infection but without symptoms and dead. Our quantitative solution matches the number of sick individuals up to the most recent observation and ends with a share of sick individuals following from infection rates and sickness probabilities. We employ this framework to study inter alia the expected peak of the number of sick individuals in a scenario without public regulation of social contacts. We also study the effects of public regulations. For all scenarios we report the expected end of the CoV-2 epidemic. We have four general findings: First, current epidemiological thinking implies that the long-run effects of the epidemic only depend on the aggregate long-run infection rate and on the individual risk to turn sick after an infection. Any measures by individuals and the public therefore only influence the dynamics of spread of CoV-2. Second, predictions about the duration and level of the epidemic must strongly distinguish between the officially reported numbers (Robert Koch Institut, RKI) and actual numbers of sick individuals. Third, given the current (scarce) medical knowledge about long-run infection rate and individual risks to turn sick, any prediction on the length (duration in months) and strength (e.g. maximum numbers of sick individuals on a given day) is subject to a lot of uncertainty. Our predictions therefore offer robustness analyses that provide ranges on how long the epidemic will last and how strong it will be. Fourth, public interventions that are already in place and that are being discussed can lead to more and less severe outcomes of the epidemic. If an intervention takes place too early, the epidemic can actually be stronger than with an intervention that starts later. Interventions should therefore be contingent on current infection rates in regions or countries. Concerning predictions about COVID-19 in Germany, we find that the long-run number of sick individuals (that are reported to the RKI), once the epidemic is over, will lie between 500 thousand and 5 million individuals. While this seems to be an absurdly large range for a precise projection, this reflects the uncertainty about the long-run infection rate in Germany. If we assume that Germany will follow the good scenario of Hubei (and we are even a bit more conservative given discussions about data quality), we will end up with 500 thousand sick individuals over the entire epidemic. If by contrast we believe (as many argue) that once the epidemic is over 70% of the population will have been infected (and thereby immune), we will end up at 5 million cases. Defining the end of the epidemic by less than 100 newly reported sick individuals per day, we find a large variation depending on the effectiveness of governmental pleas and regulations to reduce social contacts. An epidemic that is not influenced by public health measures would end mid June 2020. With public health measures lasting for few weeks, the end is delayed by around one month or two. The advantage of the delay, however, is to reduce the peak number of individuals that are simultaneously sick. When we believe in long-run infection rates of 70%, this number is equally high for all scenarios we went through and well above 1 million. When we can hope for the Hubei-scenario, the maximum number of sick individuals will be around 200 thousand only. Whatever value of the range of long-run infection rates we want to assume, the epidemic will last at least until June, with extensive and potentially future public health measures, it will last until July. In the worst case, it will last until end of August. We emphasize that all projections are subject to uncertainty and permanent monitoring of observed incidences are taken into account to update the projection.

            "abstract": "This document depicts an empirical approach to the dynamics of diagnosed CoVid19 infections at outbreak scenarios. Here we study empirical daily diagnosed infections and by performing an initial study based on basic models of infection spreads, we find two distinct exponential regimes in which the CoVid19 displays an infection growth rate. Here, measures such as household lockdown are critical in order to lower the infection rate. As a result, a crossover point between fast and slow infection rates is found one week after lockdown, which is turn is the average CoVid19\u2019s incubation period. After this crossover point, and following the slow growth rate, infections reach a maximum after which the infection rate starts to decrease. A possible peak can be found latter to this lockdown critical point, due to a number of households being infected by subjects already sick from the spread periods. However, such peak is a singularity as due to lockdown the diagnosed infections keep decreasing exponentially. Note that this profile, which we have denoted as Whuan Quality-Curve (Or Whuan Q-Curve) is characteristic to the evolution of CoVid19 in china as infected countries such as Spain or Italy still are at early stages of the Whuan Q-Curve. However, both countries display such profile up to date. Furthermore, our analysis and the proposal of the Q-Curve as a master curve to consider in each CoVid19 outbreak, allows a prediction of outbreak periods, i.e. free spread or lockdown periods, as well as diagnosed cases over time, provided that an initial data analysis is performed at the beginning of the outbreak. We also study the case of South Korea, where early measures where implemented against CoVid19. Finally, data indicates that a soft or hard lockdown result in the same outcome when fighting against CoVid19.",

            "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID19 has been declared a global pandemic by WHO which started in Wuhan last November and now has spread to more than 200 countries with 4.5 million cases and a death toll of more than 300 thousand. In response, many countries have implemented lock down to ensure social distancing and started rigorously quarantining the infected subjects. Here we utilized the infection dynamics available from WHO and quantitatively calibrated the confirmed, recovered, and dead populations from 23 different countries. The chosen countries chosen are in three stages of infection 1. Where the first wave of infection is significantly diminished 2. Infection peak is reached but daily infection still persists significantly 3. The infection peak is not yet reached. The model successfully captured the daily trajectories of countries with both early and late phase of infection and determined incubation time, transmission rate, quarantine and recovery rates. Our analysis shows, the reduction in the estimated reproduction number with time is significantly correlated to the testing rate and medical facility of a country. Further, our model identifies that an increase in quarantine rate through more testing could be the most potent strategy to substantially reduce the undetected infection, accelerate the time to infection peak and facilitate faster recovery of a nation from the first infection wave, which could perhaps have direct social and economic implications. Our model also shows, that post lockdown infection spread towards a much larger second wave can be controlled via rigorous increase in the quarantine rates which could be tailored in a country specific manner; for instance, our simulations suggest that USA or Spain would require a 10 fold more increase in quarantine rates compared to India to control the second wave post lockdown. Our data driven modeling and analysis of the trajectories from multiple countries thus pave a way to understand the infection dynamics during and post lockdown phases in various countries and it can help strategize the testing and quarantine processes and influence the spread of the disease in future.

The models are calibrated with the epidemiological data of Greece, while data from Switzerland and Germany are used as a supplementary background. The developed models are capable of estimating parameters of primary importance such as the reproduction number and the real magnitude of the infection in Greece. A clear demonstration of how the social distancing interventions managed to promptly restrict the epidemic growth in the country is included. The stochastic models are also able to generate robust 30-day and 60-day forecast scenarios in terms of new cases, deaths, active cases and recoveries.",

Workers voluntarily underwent serological testing before vaccination (T1), at least 15 days after vaccination (T2), and at least 150 days after vaccination (T3). We picked individuals who had received two doses of the vaccine. As for positivity, we assessed incidence \u2013 and therefore symptomatology \u2013 in three time intervals. We used a contingency tables for the analysis and tested the relation to the chi-square test and ANOVA test. Regarding differentials in terms of antibody capacity, we considered different time intervals: the methodological approach was the same.\n\nResults\nThe average value of the dimeric serological testing at T1 was equal to 28.80 AU/mL, which increased to 220.55 AU/mL at T2, and then decreased to 143.62 AU/mL at T3 (P = 0.000). At T2, the number of people with a protective titer was equal to 95.96% of the total; at T3, it was equal to 96.39% (P = 0.019). Before the vaccination campaign, 75 workers tested positive (25 paucisymptoms, 4 severe symptoms).

Sisonke 2 enrolled 227 310 HCW from the 8 November to the 17 December 2021.

We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine booster in 69 092 HCW as compared to unvaccinated individuals enrolled in the same managed care organization using a test negative design. We compared VE against COVID19 admission for omicron during the period 15 November to 20 December 2021. After adjusting for confounders, we observed that VE for hospitalisation increased over time since booster dose, from 63% (95%CI 31-81%); to 84% (95% CI 67-92%) and then 85% (95% CI: 54-95%), 0-13 days, 14-27 days, and 1-2 months post-boost. We provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of a homologous Ad26.COV.2 vaccine boost given 6-9 months after the initial single vaccination series during a period of omicron variant circulation.

The COVID19 pandemic has presented new challenges to healthcare infrastructure, virology, vaccinology research, and implementation science. Misinformation concerning vaccines and nonpharmacologic measures to mitigate the spread of COVID19 has made the study of vaccine efficacy extremely important for both transparency and accountability. The vaccines for COVID19 were developed with urgency but without compromise of any safety or regulatory measures. They are undoubtedly the most efficacious means of disease mitigation we currently have available. As of this writing, 11.7 billion doses have been given worldwide, with 578 million in the USA alone. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the coronavirus, new variants continue to emerge. When dealing with a rapidly changing pathogen, it is essential to continuously review and update the known data, as manuscripts become outdated as soon as the first draft is written. In this issue of Journal of Investigative Medicine, Hirsh et al reviewed the breakthrough COVID19 infections in vaccination but emphasize the overwhelming effectiveness of the vaccines overall. The article cites the known efficacy of the mRNA vaccines as 95% against symptomatic infection in initial studies. Even with the advent of newer variants and their increased immune evasion, severe infections, hospitalization, and death are still much more common in the unvaccinated compared with the vaccinated population; however, this effect is diminished in the vaccinated cohort who are immunocompromised or more elderly. During the Delta and subsequent Omicron surges, this predominance of severe disease among the unvaccinated was repeatedly illustrated by the published illustrations from numerous hospitals showing the disproportionate number of unvaccinated patients admitted to the COVID19 wards, critical care units, and on the ventilators. The other benefits of vaccination, such as reduction in detectable viral load and reduction in contagious period, are more difficult to measure on a populationwide level. Even as we write, the current variants of concern in the USA now include BA.2, which is quickly being outcompeted by BA.2.12.1. Meanwhile, the WHO is tracking the rapid spread of BA.4 and BA.5 internationally, as well as its recent arrival in the USA. With each variant, the performance of the vaccination or native immunity is again called into question. Ongoing studies report that vaccine efficacy against the Omicron variant is maintained against severe disease, although to a lesser extent for symptomatic disease and infection among both mRNA and inactivated vaccines. However, these benefits are highly dependent on receipt of booster doses as well as time from vaccination. There remains no consensus on the frequency or number of booster doses that will ultimately be required as these new variants appear. Recent data also suggest that fourth vaccine doses in the general population again offer improved protection against infection and severe disease compared with three doses. The issue of the waning immunity of the population, especially at the extremes of age, and the issue of vaccine availability to the very young or the disadvantaged continue to require further investigation and appropriate action. The United Nations estimates that only 1% of COVID19 vaccines administered worldwide have been in developing countries. This has farreaching repercussions; the generation of variants, like in the mutation of the wellknown pandemic virus, HIV, is directly related to the amount of uncontrolled viral replication that is allowed. More unvaccinated cohorts will allow the virus to replicate freely and increase the odds of forming new and potentially more virulent variants. This makes the issues of expanding availability and eligibility for vaccination of paramount importance. Humanity has been fortunate with maintained vaccine efficacy; although as a result, the other nonpharmacologic interventions to prevent COVID19 spread have been dropped as the public perception of risk has decreased. This only increases the need for continued timely, quality, peerreviewed data on which to base future public health decisionmaking. Whether there may yet be a variant which escapes the vaccine\u2019s curated antibodies and adversely impacts that risk calculation\u2014only time will tell.",

Dear Editor, We would like to comment on the publication \u2018COVID19 vaccine efficacy in a rapidly changing landscape\u2019. A very small number of persons will still exhibit symptoms, require hospitalization, or pass away from COVID19, according to Baer and Tran\u2019s prediction. Therefore, it is critical to identify and thoroughly characterize the impact of a specific mutation for the pathogenesis of SARCoV2. As the pandemic spreads, we should keep up our efforts to sequence and monitor SARSCoV2 evolution and modify vaccine plans as necessary. Due to the dangerous nature of COVID19 and the vast spectrum of clinical symptoms it causes, immunization is crucial for efficient illness management. The vaccine\u2019s effectiveness is influenced by a number of variables. Since an asymptomatic COVID19 may commonly have a puzzling effect, the data that are now available may be incomplete. However, it must consider the possibility of asymptomatic COVID19 in the populations being studied. Asymptomatic infections may become symptomatic during the observation period, changing the prognosis. The history of infection, which is a key factor in predicting the clinical course of the immunological response to infection and immunization, cannot be used to rule out COVID19 silent infections. Finally, it should be noted that the type of vaccination used and the manner of delivery both affect the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness. There are many different vaccination types available today, and the methods of delivery vary, depending on the country. Many nations still use the inactivated COVID19 vaccine, which is no longer efficacious, and heterologous mixing immunization. Low vaccine efficacy could be caused by an additional method of delivery, and this could be connected to the problem with the newly discovered COVID19 variation.",

Over the short term, plasmid DNA vaccines can be developed as they are molecularly stable, thus facilitating easy transport and storage. pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co was designed for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) S protein. The antibodies produced led to immunoreactions against the S protein, an anti-receptor-binding-domain, and a neutralizing action of the pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co, as previously confirmed. To promote the efficacy of the pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co vaccine a pyro-drive jet injector (PJI) was used. An intradermally adjusted PJI demonstrated that the pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co vaccine injection caused a high production of anti-S protein antibodies, triggered immunoreactions, and neutralized the actions against SARS-CoV-2. A high-dose pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co intradermal injection using PJI did not cause any serious disorders in the rat model. A viral challenge confirmed that intradermally immunized mice were potently protected from COVID-19. A pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co intradermal injection using PJI is a safe and promising vaccination method for overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Intradermally-adjusted PJI demonstrated that pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co vaccine injection caused a strong production of anti-S protein antibodies, triggered immunoreactions and neutralizing actions against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, a high dose of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co intradermal injection via PJI did not cause any serious disorders in the rat model. Finally, virus infection challenge in mice, confirmed that intradermally immunized (via PJI) mice were potently protected from COVID-19 infection.

However, an effective vaccine is essential to containing the spread of the virus. The first doses were distributed at the end of 2020, but the efficacy, period of immunity it will provide, and percentage of coverage still remain unclear. We developed a compartment model to examine different vaccine strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Our framework accounts for testing rates, test-turnaround times, and vaccination waning immunity. Using reported case data from the city of Toronto, Canada between Mar-Dec, 2020 we defined epidemic phases of infection using contact rates, which depend on individuals duration of time spent within the household, workplace/school, or community settings, as well as the probability of transmission upon contact. We investigated the impact of vaccine distribution by comparing different permutations of waning immunity, vaccine coverage and efficacy throughout various stages of NPIs relaxation in terms of cases, deaths, and household transmission, as measured using the basic reproduction number (R0). We observed that widespread vaccine coverage substantially reduced the number of cases and deaths. In order for NPIs to be relaxed 8 months after vaccine distribution, infection spread can be kept under control with either 60% vaccine coverage, no waning immunity, and 70% efficacy, or with 60% coverage with a 12-month waning immunity and 90% vaccine efficacy. Widespread virus resurgence can result when the immunity wanes under 3 months and/or when NPIs are relaxed in concomitance with vaccine distribution. In addition to vaccination, our analysis of R0 showed that the basic reproduction number is reduced by decreasing the tests turnaround time and transmission in the household. While we found that household transmission can decrease following the introduction of a vaccine, public health efforts to reduce test turnaround times remain important for virus containment. Our findings suggest that vaccinating two-thirds of the population with a vaccine that is at least 70% effective may be sufficient for controlling COVID-19 spread, as long as NPIs are not immediately relaxed.",

Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials demonstrated its high immunogenicity, promoting neutralizing IgG together with specific T-cell response. A third dose of SOBERANA Plus (SARS-CoV-2 RBD-dimer) further increased the specific anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies. Methods: In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial we randomly assigned 44 031 participants, aged 19-80 years to three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 28 days apart either a) two doses of 25 microg SOBERANA 02, or b) two doses of 25 microg SOBERANA 02 followed by a third dose of 50 microg SOBERANA Plus, or c) two doses of placebo. Reported study endpoints are vaccine efficacy (VE) evaluated through laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases and safety. During the trial, the SARS CoV-2 isolates in Havana were predominantly (beta 74.0 %) and shift gradually to delta (100%). Results: Two doses of SOBERANA 02 protects against symptomatic COVID-19: 43 cases in the two-dose group (14 371) vs. 155 in the placebo group (14 403), VE 71.0%, adjusted (CI 95%58.9-79.1). The heterologous three dose combination with SOBERANA Plus protected against symptomatic COVID-19: 15 cases in the vaccine groups (13 833) vs. 155 in the placebo group (14 303), VE 92.4%, adjusted (CI 95% 86.9-95.6%). For two-dose schedule VE against severe COVID-19 was 63.0% and for death 59.0%; for heterologous three-dose schedule, 100% in both cases. Conclusions: This is the first phase 3 study of a three-dose, heterologous vaccine combination against SARS-CoV-2. Two doses of the conjugate vaccine SOBERANA 02 was safe and attained efficacy of 71.0% in adults population 19-80 y/o; incorporating SOBERANA Plus after two doses of SOBERANA 02, increased efficacy from 71.0 % to 92.4% (Clinical Trials IFV/COR/09 number, RPCEC00000354.)",

The sample size was based on finding 130 individuals who were enrolled in the trial to have COVID19; in estimating the sample size, they assumed a 1% attack rate among the unvaccinated (or placebo), and a 60% Vaccine Efficacy with 95% confidence interval. When these figures were entered in the WHO sample size calculator for vaccine efficacy studies [1], it turned out that the study would need 86, 000 participants. By that standard, the study was underpowered 2. While the study was designed to be placebo controlled double blind studies, it relied on voluntary participation of people, and it was not clear how participants in the study were recruited, i.e., from what sources or how did they obtain the participants. As a result, a self-reporting bias could not be ruled out. 3. While the study employed masking and blinding of the participants and \u201cthose associated\u201d with the study, the study data analysts were unblinded and therefore risks of biases in the analyses of the data could not be ruled out 4. For any RCT, external validity is an issue [2], and whether the results obtained in this phase III trial can be widely applied to others and for prevention of newer variants of concern is not clear. 5. An average efficacy of 77% for symptomatic COVID19 for those who are fully vaccinated (i.e., 2 weeks after two completed doses and continuously monitored) is about 14% lower than the mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-Biontec) as reported by The CDC (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html) 6. Problems with allocation concealment is a known problem in clinical trials [3]; while the article stated that they had adopted \u201callocation concealment\u201d, how that was achieved was not clearly stated in the methods section 7. This clinical trial adopted a per protocol analysis of the results. This can lead to several problems including those of biased analyses, and reduction in power, as described previously [4] Qeios, CC-BY 4.0 \u00b7 Review, July 4, 2021",

The main goal of this study was to analyze factors that may influence the humoral response to vaccination. Methods: We analyzed the titer magnitude of IgG antibodies directed against spike (S)-SARS-CoV-2 antigen after the second dose of the mRNA vaccine in 142 infection na\u00efve KTR (83 men, i.e., 58.4%) with a median age (IQR) of 54 (41\u201363), and 36 respective controls without chronic kidney disease. mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 were applied in 26% and 74% of KTR, respectively. Results: S-specific immune response (seroconversion) was seen in 73 (51.41%) of KTR, and in all controls 36 (100%). Independent predictors of no response were elder age, shorter transplantation vintage, and a more than two-drug immunosuppressive protocol. In subgroup analyses, the seroconversion rate was highest among KTR without MMF/MPS treatment (70%), treated with no more than two immunosuppressants (69.2%), treated without corticosteroid (66.7%), younger patients aged <54 years (63.2%), and those vaccinated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine (62.16%). The independent predictors of higher S-antibody titer among responders were younger age, treatment with no more than two immunosuppressants, and the mRNA-1273 vaccination. Conclusions: Our study confirmed a low rate of seroconversion after vaccination with the mRNA vaccine in KTR. The major modifiable determinants of humoral response were the composition of the immunosuppressive protocol, as well as the type of vaccine. The latter could be taken into consideration when initial vaccination as well as booster vaccination is considered in KTR.",

The virus, termed SARS-CoV-2, is generally asymptomatic but contagious and might have originated from bats. Nowadays, the mechanisms underlying the infection and the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 are distinguishable from previous coronaviruses. Early diagnosis and supportive treatment are necessary to cure the patients with COVID-19. Early evidence recommended that children are just likely as adults to become infected with this novel virus. It is now established that children are more often show gastrointestinal manifestations than adults do, and many children affected by SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic. Over 300 vaccine projects are recently developed by the scientific community to treat COVID-19 disease; however, these vaccines might lose efficacy by a number of unpredicted issues, including the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 mutants. \nConclusion: Due to the high prevalence and worldwide widespread of COVID-19, many studies are underway to find treatment modalities and develop new vaccines or antiviral substances to fight the virus. The COVID-19 pandemic is not only a challenge to global health but also has globally affected mental, social, and economic health. Moreover, the post-corona pandemic condition will undoubtedly have many Socioeconomic Challenges. This review study has been focused on epidemiology, virology, transmission methods, clinical features, laboratory findings, and prevalent mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We hope that information provided within this article will significantly benefit researchers currently investigating COVID-19 patients.",

Extremely high infection and mortality rate has severely affected all sectors of life and derailed the global economy. While drug and vaccine development have been prioritized and have made significant progression, use of phytochemicals and herbal constituents is deemed as a low-cost, safer and readily available alternative. We investigated therapeutic efficacy of eight withanolides (derived from Ashwagandha) against the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins, a target cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and report results on the (i) computational analyses including binding affinity and stable interactions with ACE2, occupancy of ACE2 residues in making polar and nonpolar interactions with different withanolides/ligands and (2) in vitro mRNA and protein analyses using human cancer (A549, MCF7 and HSC3) cells. We found that among all withanolides, Withaferin-A, Withanone, Withanoside-IV and Withanoside-V significantly inhibited the ACE2 expression. Analysis of withanolides-rich aqueous extracts derived from Ashwagandha leaves and stem showed a higher ACE2 inhibitory potency of stem-derived extracts. Taken together, we demonstrated the inhibitory potency of Ashwagandha withanolides and its aqueous extracts against ACE2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma",

            "abstract": "Introduction The management of COVID19 is complicated by vaccine availability, the modest efficacy of existing treatments, and the potential for viral resistance. Therefore, there is a pressing need for new prophylactic and therapeutic agents. The viral receptor ACE2 is an ideal target as it is required for SARS-CoV-2 entry in host cells. Modifying ACE2 expression could prevent infection and/or limit disease progression. Nevertheless, the mechanisms controlling ACE2 expression remain elusive. Aims To identify pathways controlling the transcriptional regulation of ACE2, and exploit them to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Organoids from primary biliary, intestinal and pulmonary epithelia were derived and cultured as previously described. Single-cell RNA sequencing, QPCR, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were used to assess marker expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to assess FXR binding on DNA. Bronchoalveolar lavage SARS-CoV-2 patient isolates were used for infection experiments. Human livers not used for transplantation were connected to the metra (OrganOx) normothermic perfusion device and perfused ex-situ using therapeutic doses of UDCA for 12 hours. ACE2 activity was measured following manufacturer's instructions. Patient data from the COVID-Hep and SECURE-Liver registries were compared using propensity score matching for sex, age and Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. Results We first demonstrated that cholangiocytes are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo and in organoid culture. We then used cholangiocyte organoids to identify FXR as a transcriptional regulator of ACE2. We validated our results in pulmonary and intestinal organoids, showing that ACE2 regulation by FXR represents a broad mechanism present in multiple COVID19-affected tissues. We then demonstrated that approved FXR inhibitors, such as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and z-guggulsterone (ZGG), decrease ACE2 levels and reduce viral infection in vitro in primary biliary, intestinal and pulmonary organoids. We interrogated the impact of systemic UDCA administration in human livers perfused ex-situ, demonstrating reduced ACE2 levels and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we showed that commencing UDCA treatment lowers ACE2 levels in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) patients. Finally, we identified a correlation between UDCA treatment and better clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients, including hospitalisation, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and death, using registry data. Conclusion We identified FXR as a novel master regulator of ACE2 expression. Using a bench-to-bedside approach we combined in vitro, ex-vivo and patient data to demonstrate the efficacy of ACE2 downregulation against SARS-CoV-2 infection and identified approved and inexpensive drugs (UDCA, ZGG) which could be repurposed as prophylactic and therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection, paving the road for future clinical trials.",

            "abstract": "Dear Editor, The introduction of vaccines against COVID19 was a pivotal step in the quest to break the global pandemic (Wouters et al., 2021). Various vaccines are currently in use (Wouters et al., 2021): viral vector (AstraZeneca, J&J, Gameleya), mRNA (Moderna, Biontech/ Pfizer), and inactivated SARSCoV2 virus (Sinopharm). The safety and efficacy profiles of all vaccines appear to be favorable (Wu et al., 2021). Limited local reactions at the injection site are most commonly reported after the vaccine administration (Wu et al., 2021). Severe adverse events seem to be rare (0.1%) (Wu et al., 2021). In the progress of the vaccination campaign, more knowledge about possible side effects is surfacing. It is difficult to establish causative associations between conspicuous (possibly rare) clinical findings and COVID vaccine administration (AnayaSaavedra, 2021). However, a meticulous surveillance of possible side effects is warranted. Cutaneous/mucosal side effects (allergic and nonallergic) in the wake of vaccinations are well described (Rosenblatt & Stein, 2015). A rare vaccinationassociated event is the onset of lichen planus (LP) (Lai & Yew, 2017). A review published in 2017 found a total of 33 cases of LP arising after various vaccinations (Lai & Yew, 2017). Most cases of LP (very rarely with oral manifestations) were observed within a fortnight following a Hepatitis B, Influenza, or Herpes zoster vaccination (inactivated/attenuated virus vaccinations) (Lai & Yew, 2017). Recently published reports have associated COVID19 vaccinations with the emergence of LP or the exacerbation of oral LP (OLP) (Hiltun et al., 2021; Kulkarni & Sollecito, 2021; Merhy et al., 2021). LP and OLP are the clinical correlate of an autoimmunologic reaction of mainly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells against epidermal basal layer keratinocytes which induces keratinocyte apoptosis (Nogueira et al., 2015). This process is maintained by the release of IL2, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3 by CD4+ (Th1) lymphocytes (Hiltun et al., 2021; Nogueira et al., 2015). The LP/OLPassociated immune reaction is represented histologically by the accumulation of lymphocytic infiltrates in the basal epidermal layer. An intended effect of all COVID19 vaccines is the broad immune system stimulation which induces a Tcell driven response with Bcell activation, antibody production, and increased levels of cytokines including IL2, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3 (Alter et al., 2021). Longlasting immunologic responses have been shown for the Ad26. COV2.S vaccine (Alter et al., 2021). Literature searches failed to reveal descriptions of COVID19 vaccineassociated initial manifestations of OLP without extraoral efflorescences. This may be the first report of OLP onset in a timely association with the COVID19 vaccination (Ad26.COV2.S). A 49yearold male patient presented with a 9week history of oral mucosal discomfort, burning sensations, and desquamation that had developed six days after the COVID19 vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. The patient had suffered from flulike symptoms for three days immediately following the vaccination. The clinical examination showed the classical image of OLP (Figure 1). The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by a surgical biopsy. The patient was treated with a fourweek course of topical clobetasol mouth",

For these patients, prophylactic infusion of monoclonal anti\u2013 SARSCoV2 antibodies can be offered, although we have less insight regarding the longterm efficacy when compared with the vaccines. The immunosuppression regimen classically administered to LT recipients is a combination of tacrolimus and MMF.[5] However, in various situations, MMF can be stopped or discontinued without increasing the risk of acute graft rejection, especially in lowrisk patients. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of a temporary discontinuation of MMF on vaccine response after a fourth dose of vaccine in nonresponding LT recipients.",

Workers voluntarily underwent serological testing before vaccination (T1), at least 15 days after vaccination (T2), and at least 150 days after vaccination (T3). We picked individuals who had received two doses of the vaccine. As for positivity, we assessed incidence \u2013 and therefore symptomatology \u2013 in three time intervals. We used a contingency tables for the analysis and tested the relation to the chi-square test and ANOVA test. Regarding differentials in terms of antibody capacity, we considered different time intervals: the methodological approach was the same.\n\nResults\nThe average value of the dimeric serological testing at T1 was equal to 28.80 AU/mL, which increased to 220.55 AU/mL at T2, and then decreased to 143.62 AU/mL at T3 (P = 0.000). At T2, the number of people with a protective titer was equal to 95.96% of the total; at T3, it was equal to 96.39% (P = 0.019). Before the vaccination campaign, 75 workers tested positive (25 paucisymptoms, 4 severe symptoms).

            "abstract": "Efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have relied heavily on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including physical distancing, hand hygiene, and mask-wearing. However, an effective vaccine is essential to containing the spread of the virus. The first doses were distributed at the end of 2020, but the efficacy, period of immunity it will provide, and percentage of coverage still remain unclear. We developed a compartment model to examine different vaccine strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Our framework accounts for testing rates, test-turnaround times, and vaccination waning immunity. Using reported case data from the city of Toronto, Canada between Mar-Dec, 2020 we defined epidemic phases of infection using contact rates, which depend on individuals duration of time spent within the household, workplace/school, or community settings, as well as the probability of transmission upon contact. We investigated the impact of vaccine distribution by comparing different permutations of waning immunity, vaccine coverage and efficacy throughout various stages of NPIs relaxation in terms of cases, deaths, and household transmission, as measured using the basic reproduction number (R0). We observed that widespread vaccine coverage substantially reduced the number of cases and deaths. In order for NPIs to be relaxed 8 months after vaccine distribution, infection spread can be kept under control with either 60% vaccine coverage, no waning immunity, and 70% efficacy, or with 60% coverage with a 12-month waning immunity and 90% vaccine efficacy. Widespread virus resurgence can result when the immunity wanes under 3 months and/or when NPIs are relaxed in concomitance with vaccine distribution. In addition to vaccination, our analysis of R0 showed that the basic reproduction number is reduced by decreasing the tests turnaround time and transmission in the household. While we found that household transmission can decrease following the introduction of a vaccine, public health efforts to reduce test turnaround times remain important for virus containment. Our findings suggest that vaccinating two-thirds of the population with a vaccine that is at least 70% effective may be sufficient for controlling COVID-19 spread, as long as NPIs are not immediately relaxed.",

            "abstract": "Introduction Pfizer-BioNTech collaboration started in 2018 in order to develop mRNA flu vaccine. Because of the covid19 pandemic the two companies started to focus on mRNA vaccine development for the prevention of covid19 infection. In March they signed the Letters of Intent. Initially there were four vaccine candidates including unmodified mRNA, nucleoside-modified mRNA and self-amplifying mRNA. For further development the nucleoside- modified mRNA was chosen. In April Phase 1/2 study was completed in Germany and in May in the USA. Two 30 \u03bcg doses 3 weeks apart induced neutralizing antibody titers comparable to natural infection and strong CD4+ and CD8+ Tcell responses were observed. Phase 2b/3 clinical trial started in July involving more than 43.000 participants in 153 sites. The result showed 95% efficacy with mild and moderate local and systemic events. For safety reason all participants will be followed for 2 years after the second dose. Based on rolling review regulatory agencies were able to approve within a short period of time in December 2020, first MHRA in UK, then FDA authorized for Emergency Use and EMA granted Conditional Marketing Authorization on 21 December 2021 for 16 years old and older. The first shipments were sent all European countries on 27 December. Direct shipments to vaccination centers on ultra-low temperature (minus 9060 degree of centigrade) using dry ice. Each thermal shipping container has a temperature monitoring device. All shipments are tracked via GPS monitoring device to ensure end-to-end distribution within required temperatures. In May EMA granted an extension of indication for covid-19 vaccine to include in children aged 12-15. The effect of vaccine was investigated in 2260 children aged 12-15, about half of them received dummy injection. Of the 1,005 children receiving the vaccine, none developed COVID-19 compared to 16 children out of the 978 who received the dummy injection. This means that, in this study, the vaccine was 100% effective at preventing COVID-19. The most common side effects in children aged 12 to 15 are similar like those in people aged 16 and above. They include pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. These effects are usually mild or moderate and improve within a few days from the vaccination. EMA granted approval for booster dose (third dose) for immune weakened people 28 days after the second dose, and 6 months after the second dose for 18 years of age and older. Approval is based on the clinical program evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a booster dose of covid-19 vaccine. A booster dose of the vaccine elicited significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against the initial SARS-CoV-2 virus (wild type), as well as the Beta and Delta variants, when compared with the levels observed after the two-dose primary series. The reactogenicity profile within seven days after the booster dose was typically mild to moderate, and the frequency of reactions was similar to or lower than after dose two. The efficacy is this trial was 95,6%. In October 2021 FDA authorized for emergency use of covid-19 for children 5 through 111 years of age. For this age group, the vaccine is to be admin-istered in a two-dose regimen of 10 \u03bcg (0,2 ml) doses given 21 days apart. EUA is supported by clinical data showing a favorable safety profile and high vaccine efficacy of 90.7% in children 5 through 11 years of age during a period when Delta was the prevalent strain. In 2021 we have already distributed 1,8B doses to 146 countries by end of September. In 2022 we plan to distribute 4B doses. (Figure Presented).",

            "abstract": "7532 Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent leukemia in the western world. Primarily affecting older patients, CLL increases the risk of infection due to immunosuppression from underlying disease and treatments. With the COVID19 pandemic now in its third year, vaccines remain one of our best protections against infection. However, people with CLL historically have decreased vaccine efficacy; hence protection from the COVID19 vaccines is uncertain. Furthermore, it is unknown if antibodies generated in response to vaccination confer immunity. Therefore, we tested for presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies post vaccination to determine if a response was generated and led to a decreased risk of breakthrough infections. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with CLL who received at least one COVID19 vaccine. Spike protein antibodies were assessed in a CLIA-approved laboratory. Detectable spike protein antibodies after vaccination were assessed, excluding those detected any time after Cilgavimab-Tixagevimab administration, within 90 days after any monoclonal antibody or convalescent plasma, or after covid infection post vaccine to best capture antibody responses from the vaccine. Logistic regression model was used to assess the odds of antibody development. Fine-Gray model was used to assess risk of breakthrough infections. Results: 477 patients were included in this study with median age of 60.4 years. Patients were predominately male (64.8%) and white (97.3%). 70.4% of patients had received at least one treatment for CLL. 45.5% of patients were on CLL treatment at time of vaccination, with the majority (87.6%) of these treated with BTK inhibitors either as monotherapy or with a BCL2 inhibitor or anti CD-20 therapy. Three hundred thirteen (68.2%) of the patients had a detectable antibody after vaccination. Those who received CLL treatment were less likely to have detectable antibody response compared to those not on treatment (OR = 0.19, p < 0.0001). Compared with patients who received Moderna vaccine, Pfizer (OR = 0.15, p < .01) and Janssen (OR = 0.46, p = 0.29) vaccine receivers were less likely to have detectable antibodies. Eighty (17.2%) patients developed COVID19 infection after vaccination, with 5% mortality from COVID19. Those who received Pfizer vaccines had a higher risk of infection (HR = 2.25, p = 0.0016). Regardless of vaccine type, those who had antibodies post vaccination had a decreased risk for infection (HR = 0.38, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Among patients who were vaccinated against COVID19, those who received CLL treatment were less likely to develop antibodies compared to untreated patients, indicating that treatment decreases vaccine efficacy. We show that detectable antibodies after vaccination decrease risk for infection. Moderna appears to have greater efficacy, with more patients having positive antibody titers and a lower risk of developing COVID19.",

However, some of these patients did not achieve seroconversion. Here, we investigated the safety and efficacy of a third dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in Japanese allogeneic HSCT patients. Antibody titers against the S1 spike protein were measured using the QuaResearch COVID-19 Human IgM IgG ELISA kit. The previous study included 25 allogeneic HSCT patients who received two doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Following the exclusion of three patients because of the development of COVID-19 (n = 2) and loss to follow-up (n = 1), the study evaluated 22 allogeneic HSCT patients who received a third dose of COVID19 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 [n = 15] and mRNA1273 [n = 7]). Median age at the time of the first vaccination was 56 (range, 23-71) years. Median time from HSCT to the third vaccination and from the second to the third vaccination was 1842 (range, 378-4279) days and 219 (range, 194-258) days, respectively. Five patients were receiving immunosuppressants at the third vaccination, namely calcineurin inhibitors (CI) alone (n = 1), steroids alone (n = 2), or CI combined with steroids (n = 2). Median optical density of S1 IgG titers before and after the third dose was 0.099 (range, 0.001-0.713) and 1.315 (range, 0.006-1.730), respectively. Among 22 evaluable patients, 21 (95%) seroconverted after the third dose. Four of the five patients treated with steroids or CI seroconverted after the third vaccination. One patient with a serum IgG level of 173 mg/dL who received steroids did not achieve seroconversion. On one-week follow-up, none of our patients had > grade 3 or serious adverse events, new onset graft versus host disease (GVHD), or GVHD exacerbation after vaccination. The most frequent adverse event was mild pain at the injection site. A third dose of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines was safe and effective for allogeneic HSCT patients.",

In spite of the considerable progress in the development of the COVID-19 vaccines, adequate vaccination coverage has not been achieved even in the most developed countries, and a significant gap still exists among high-, middle-, and low-income countries. While vaccination plays a central role in controlling COVID-19\u2019s spread, some concerns remain surrounding the emergence of resistance of new variants against available vaccines and their waning of efficacy over time. The assessment of the neutralization efficiency of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine against different variants showed that neutralization against the omicron variant is lower compared with the previous variants of concern, even after the third dose of vaccine. Accordingly, evaluation of the effectiveness of 2 doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or ChAdOx1 nCoV19 (AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccines showed limited protection against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron variant. Notably, a booster dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) after primary immunization led to considerably improved protection against the omicron variant; however, the protection waned notably during the time.1\u20133 While it is clear that vaccination is the most effective tool for control of the pandemic, other important tools include anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antiviral medications that are discussed.",

The uncertainty exists along multiple dimensions such as virus mutations, infectivity and severity of new mutants, efficacy of vaccines against new mutants, waning of vaccine induced immunity over time, and lockdown / opening-up policies effected by city authorities. Moreover, this uncertainty plays out in a non-uniform manner across nations, states, cities, and even within the cities thus leading to highly heterogeneous evolution of pandemic. While Work From Home (WFH) strategy has served well to meet ever-increasing business demands without compromising on individual health safety, there has been an undeniable reduction in social capital. With Covid19 pandemic showing definite waning trends, organizations are considering the possibility of safe transition from WFH to Work From Office (WFO) or a hybrid mode of operation. An effective strategy needs to score equally well on possibly interfering dimensions such as risk of infection, project delivery, and employee wellness. As large organizations will typically have a large number of offices spread across a geography, the problem of arriving at office-specific strategies becomes non-trivial. Moreover, the strategies need to adapt over time to changes that cannot be deduced upfront. This calls for an approach that is amenable to quick and easy adaptation. Our contribution in this regard is constructing a Digital Twin by leveraging various modelling techniques to realistically represent the above mentioned aspects of interest that can be subjected to what-if scenario analysis. We further demonstrate its efficacy using a case study from a large organization.",

Trials of vaccine candidates using mRNA delivery systems developed by Pfizer\u2010BioNTech and Moderna have shown substantial VEs of 94\u201395%, leading the US Food and Drug Administration to issue Emergency Use Authorizations and subsequent widespread administration of the vaccines. As the trials continue, a key issue is the possibility that VE may wane over time. Ethical considerations dictate that trial participants be unblinded and those randomized to placebo be offered study vaccine, leading to trial protocol amendments specifying unblinding strategies. Crossover of placebo subjects to vaccine complicates inference on waning of VE. We focus on the particular features of the Moderna trial and propose a statistical framework based on a potential outcomes formulation within which we develop methods for inference on potential waning of VE over time and estimation of VE at any postvaccination time. The framework clarifies assumptions made regarding individual\u2010 and population\u2010level phenomena and acknowledges the possibility that subjects who are more or less likely to become infected may be crossed over to vaccine differentially over time.

Amajor issue emerged shortly after the trials started enrolling. What to do with the placebo group after efficacy was confirmed? Although continued follow-up of the original arms was ideal to assess durability and performance against emerging strains, maintenance of the placebo arm with available efficacious vaccines was both ethically and practically untenable. A remarkable result was that the placebo controlled vaccine efficacy profile could be recovered long after the placebo group had been vaccinated. This result allows for the assessment of the durability of vaccine effect and can inform when booster vaccinations might become necessary. However, individual initiated unblinding, vaccination, and associated differential behavior can jeopardize the unbiased estimation of vaccine efficacy. In this thoughtful and elegant work Tsiatis and Davidian (TD) developmethods to fix the potential bias, motivated by and applied to the Moderna phase III clinical trial. The results are important and timely as multiple trials do and will grapple with this issue.

Furthermore, the duration of the protective response against challenge is another important consideration that drives a vaccination regimen. In the current study, we assessed the durability of two related vaccines, 0\u2206NLS and 0\u2206RING, against ocular herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) challenge in mice thirty days (short-term) and one year (long-term) following the vaccine boost. The short-term vaccine efficacy study found the 0\u2206RING vaccine to be nearly equivalent to the 0\u2206NLS vaccine in comparison to vehicle-vaccinated mice in terms of controlling virus replication and preserving the visual axis. By comparison, the long-term assessment of the two vaccines found notable differences and less efficacy overall as noted below. Specifically, the results show that in comparison to vehicle-vaccinated mice, the 0\u2206NLS and 0\u2206RING vaccinated groups were more resistant in terms of survival and virus shedding following ocular challenge. Moreover, 0\u2206NLS vaccinated mice also possessed significantly less infectious virus in the peripheral and central nervous systems but not the cornea compared to mice vaccinated with vehicle or 0\u2206RING which had similar levels. However, all vaccinated groups showed similar levels of blood and lymphatic vessel genesis into the central cornea 30 days post infection. Likewise, corneal opacity was also similar among all groups of vaccinated mice following infection. Functionally, the blink response and visual acuity were 25\u201350% lower in vaccinated mice 30 days post infection compared to measurements taken prior to infection. The results demonstrate a dichotomy between resistance to infection and functional performance of the visual axis that collectively show an overall loss in vaccine efficacy long-term in comparison to short-term studies in a conventional prime-boost protocol.",

The most recent variant is Omicron (line B.1.1.529), which was first identified in South Africa in November 2021. The concern with this variant is the ineffectiveness of vaccines currently available. We aim to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters for the Omicron variant. Methods We searched the PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases from inception to June 5th, 2022. Studies that examined the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines against the Omicron variant infection were included. Random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant. Results A total of 13 studies were included to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine against the Omicron variant, and 11 studies were included to compare the effectiveness between the two-dose and three-dose (booster) vaccinations. Full vaccination (two-dose with or without booster) showed a protective effect against the Omicron variant compared to no vaccination (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.56\u20130.69), while the effectiveness decreased significantly over 6 months after the last dose. The two-dose vaccination plus booster provided better protection against the Omicron variant compared to the two-dose vaccination without booster (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.52\u20130.68). Additional analysis was performed for the most commonly used vaccines in the United Staes: BNT162b2(Pfizer) (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.52\u20130.82) and mRNA-1273(Moderna) (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.58\u20130.88) vaccines in the US, which showed similar effectiveness compared to no vaccination. Conclusions The full dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination effectively reduces infection from the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant; however, the effectiveness wanes over time. The booster vaccine provides additional protection against the Omicron variant.",

            "abstract": "\n Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of conditions linked by chronic inflammation that increase the risk for comorbidities. Currently, 1/3 of United States adults have MetS. Globally, obesity rates have tripled since 1975, which is notable since it is a criterium used to diagnose MetS. MetS patients show higher mortality post-SARS-CoV-2 infection and poor vaccination outcomes following influenza virus vaccination when compared to metabolically healthy humans. However, the mechanisms driving MetS-induced immune dysfunction are unknown. Based on previously published work, we hypothesize that MetS-associated chronic inflammation alters programming of adaptive immune cells critical for viral control, thus enhancing disease severity and reducing vaccine efficacy. To challenge this, we use West Nile virus and SARS-CoV-2 in MetS murine models. By infecting or vaccinating chow fed wild type (WT) and high fat diet induced MetS mice, we compared immune responses over time. Our results indicate that MetS mice have higher mortality post infection, heightened viral titers, severe organ pathology, dysfunctional T and B cell responses and reduced neutralizing antibody efficacy when compared to WT mice. Further, MetS alters antibody and T cell responses post-vaccination, rendering vaccination insufficient for protecting against severe viral disease. Our results imply that MetS enhances viral disease severity and reduces vaccine efficacy. Ongoing studies in our lab are focused on determining the mechanism by which MetS alters adaptive immune cell function, with our data implicating chronic inflammation as an inducer of immune cell epigenetic changes that alter their differentiation landscapes and consequently effector functions.\n Supported by grants from NIH (R01 12781495) and DoD (USAMRDCPR192269).",

Sisonke 2 enrolled 227 310 HCW from the 8 November to the 17 December 2021. Enrolment commenced before the onset of the Omicron driven fourth wave in South Africa affording us an opportunity to evaluate early VE in preventing hospital admissions of a homologous boost of the Ad26.COV.2 vaccine given 6-9 months after the initial vaccination in HCW. We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine booster in 69 092 HCW as compared to unvaccinated individuals enrolled in the same managed care organization using a test negative design. We compared VE against COVID19 admission for omicron during the period 15 November to 20 December 2021. After adjusting for confounders, we observed that VE for hospitalisation increased over time since booster dose, from 63% (95%CI 31-81%); to 84% (95% CI 67-92%) and then 85% (95% CI: 54-95%), 0-13 days, 14-27 days, and 1-2 months post-boost. We provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of a homologous Ad26.COV.2 vaccine boost given 6-9 months after the initial single vaccination series during a period of omicron variant circulation.

They are undoubtedly the most efficacious means of disease mitigation we currently have available. As of this writing, 11.7 billion doses have been given worldwide, with 578 million in the USA alone. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the coronavirus, new variants continue to emerge. When dealing with a rapidly changing pathogen, it is essential to continuously review and update the known data, as manuscripts become outdated as soon as the first draft is written. In this issue of Journal of Investigative Medicine, Hirsh et al reviewed the breakthrough COVID19 infections in vaccination but emphasize the overwhelming effectiveness of the vaccines overall. The article cites the known efficacy of the mRNA vaccines as 95% against symptomatic infection in initial studies. Even with the advent of newer variants and their increased immune evasion, severe infections, hospitalization, and death are still much more common in the unvaccinated compared with the vaccinated population; however, this effect is diminished in the vaccinated cohort who are immunocompromised or more elderly. During the Delta and subsequent Omicron surges, this predominance of severe disease among the unvaccinated was repeatedly illustrated by the published illustrations from numerous hospitals showing the disproportionate number of unvaccinated patients admitted to the COVID19 wards, critical care units, and on the ventilators. The other benefits of vaccination, such as reduction in detectable viral load and reduction in contagious period, are more difficult to measure on a populationwide level. Even as we write, the current variants of concern in the USA now include BA.2, which is quickly being outcompeted by BA.2.12.1. Meanwhile, the WHO is tracking the rapid spread of BA.4 and BA.5 internationally, as well as its recent arrival in the USA. With each variant, the performance of the vaccination or native immunity is again called into question. Ongoing studies report that vaccine efficacy against the Omicron variant is maintained against severe disease, although to a lesser extent for symptomatic disease and infection among both mRNA and inactivated vaccines. However, these benefits are highly dependent on receipt of booster doses as well as time from vaccination. There remains no consensus on the frequency or number of booster doses that will ultimately be required as these new variants appear. Recent data also suggest that fourth vaccine doses in the general population again offer improved protection against infection and severe disease compared with three doses. The issue of the waning immunity of the population, especially at the extremes of age, and the issue of vaccine availability to the very young or the disadvantaged continue to require further investigation and appropriate action. The United Nations estimates that only 1% of COVID19 vaccines administered worldwide have been in developing countries. This has farreaching repercussions; the generation of variants, like in the mutation of the wellknown pandemic virus, HIV, is directly related to the amount of uncontrolled viral replication that is allowed. More unvaccinated cohorts will allow the virus to replicate freely and increase the odds of forming new and potentially more virulent variants. This makes the issues of expanding availability and eligibility for vaccination of paramount importance. Humanity has been fortunate with maintained vaccine efficacy; although as a result, the other nonpharmacologic interventions to prevent COVID19 spread have been dropped as the public perception of risk has decreased. This only increases the need for continued timely, quality, peerreviewed data on which to base future public health decisionmaking. Whether there may yet be a variant which escapes the vaccine\u2019s curated antibodies and adversely impacts that risk calculation\u2014only time will tell.",

Additionally, goat meat or milk may serve as a reservoir for foodborne transmission of the organism. These associations highlight the public health importance of an effective strategy to reduce E. coli O157:H7 shedding in goats. We examined the efficacy of the SRP\u00ae vaccine in goats orally challenged with E. coli O157:H7. Mixed-breed goats (n\u2009=\u200914) were randomly allocated into vaccinated and unvaccinated treatments (n\u2009=\u20097 per treatment). Goats were housed with a vaccinated and unvaccinated animal in each pen. Feces were collected for 3 weeks, then at necropsy, gastrointestinal contents were collected to determine the concentration of E. coli O157:H7. Three isolates per positive sample were saved and evaluated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to assess strain persistence over time. The mean concentration of E. coli O157:H7 in the feces of goats was numerically reduced in the vaccinated treatment; however, it was not statistically significant. In addition, the total number of days goats were fecal positive for E. coli O157:H7 were not different between vaccinated and unvaccinated treatments. Pulsotypes of isolates revealed that goats initially shed two of the four challenge strains of E. coli O157:H7, after which there was a distinct shift to two different strains. Further work is needed to evaluate cost-effective intervention strategies that reliably reduce E. coli O157:H7 shedding in goats, particularly those that may reduce the risk of transmission at public events, including petting zoos and fairs.",

It is more difficult to evaluate VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection than against symptomatic COVID-19 because infection is not observed directly but rather is known to occur between two antibody or RT-PCR tests. Additional challenges arise as community transmission changes over time and as participants are vaccinated on different dates because of staggered enrollment or crossover before the end of the study. Here, we provide valid and efficient statistical methods for estimating potentially waning VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection with blood or nasal samples under time-varying community transmission, staggered enrollment, and blinded or unblinded crossover. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods through numerical studies mimicking the BNT162b2 phase 3 trial and the Prevent COVID U study. In addition, we assess how crossover and the frequency of diagnostic tests affect the precision of VE estimates.",

            "abstract": "Efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have relied heavily on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including physical distancing, hand hygiene, and mask-wearing. However, an effective vaccine is essential to containing the spread of the virus. The first doses were distributed at the end of 2020, but the efficacy, period of immunity it will provide, and percentage of coverage still remain unclear. We developed a compartment model to examine different vaccine strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Our framework accounts for testing rates, test-turnaround times, and vaccination waning immunity. Using reported case data from the city of Toronto, Canada between Mar-Dec, 2020 we defined epidemic phases of infection using contact rates, which depend on individuals duration of time spent within the household, workplace/school, or community settings, as well as the probability of transmission upon contact. We investigated the impact of vaccine distribution by comparing different permutations of waning immunity, vaccine coverage and efficacy throughout various stages of NPIs relaxation in terms of cases, deaths, and household transmission, as measured using the basic reproduction number (R0). We observed that widespread vaccine coverage substantially reduced the number of cases and deaths. In order for NPIs to be relaxed 8 months after vaccine distribution, infection spread can be kept under control with either 60% vaccine coverage, no waning immunity, and 70% efficacy, or with 60% coverage with a 12-month waning immunity and 90% vaccine efficacy. Widespread virus resurgence can result when the immunity wanes under 3 months and/or when NPIs are relaxed in concomitance with vaccine distribution. In addition to vaccination, our analysis of R0 showed that the basic reproduction number is reduced by decreasing the tests turnaround time and transmission in the household. While we found that household transmission can decrease following the introduction of a vaccine, public health efforts to reduce test turnaround times remain important for virus containment. Our findings suggest that vaccinating two-thirds of the population with a vaccine that is at least 70% effective may be sufficient for controlling COVID-19 spread, as long as NPIs are not immediately relaxed.",

            "abstract": "Organizations are struggling to ensure business continuity without compromising on delivery excellence in the face of Covid19 pandemic related uncertainties. The uncertainty exists along multiple dimensions such as virus mutations, infectivity and severity of new mutants, efficacy of vaccines against new mutants, waning of vaccine induced immunity over time, and lockdown / opening-up policies effected by city authorities. Moreover, this uncertainty plays out in a non-uniform manner across nations, states, cities, and even within the cities thus leading to highly heterogeneous evolution of pandemic. While Work From Home (WFH) strategy has served well to meet ever-increasing business demands without compromising on individual health safety, there has been an undeniable reduction in social capital. With Covid19 pandemic showing definite waning trends, organizations are considering the possibility of safe transition from WFH to Work From Office (WFO) or a hybrid mode of operation. An effective strategy needs to score equally well on possibly interfering dimensions such as risk of infection, project delivery, and employee wellness. As large organizations will typically have a large number of offices spread across a geography, the problem of arriving at office-specific strategies becomes non-trivial. Moreover, the strategies need to adapt over time to changes that cannot be deduced upfront. This calls for an approach that is amenable to quick and easy adaptation. Our contribution in this regard is constructing a Digital Twin by leveraging various modelling techniques to realistically represent the above mentioned aspects of interest that can be subjected to what-if scenario analysis. We further demonstrate its efficacy using a case study from a large organization.",

The assessment of the neutralization efficiency of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine against different variants showed that neutralization against the omicron variant is lower compared with the previous variants of concern, even after the third dose of vaccine. Accordingly, evaluation of the effectiveness of 2 doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or ChAdOx1 nCoV19 (AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccines showed limited protection against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron variant. Notably, a booster dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) after primary immunization led to considerably improved protection against the omicron variant; however, the protection waned notably during the time.1\u20133 While it is clear that vaccination is the most effective tool for control of the pandemic, other important tools include anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antiviral medications that are discussed.",

We picked individuals who had received two doses of the vaccine. As for positivity, we assessed incidence \u2013 and therefore symptomatology \u2013 in three time intervals. We used a contingency tables for the analysis and tested the relation to the chi-square test and ANOVA test. Regarding differentials in terms of antibody capacity, we considered different time intervals: the methodological approach was the same.\n\nResults\nThe average value of the dimeric serological testing at T1 was equal to 28.80 AU/mL, which increased to 220.55 AU/mL at T2, and then decreased to 143.62 AU/mL at T3 (P = 0.000).

            "abstract": "C ritical scientific questions about COVID-19 vaccines are whether the vaccine effect will wane over time, whether they will work on new variants, and whether booster shots are needed. As reports of the durability of vaccine protection become available (1\u20134), general scientific readers should be aware of a subtle issue, known in the statistics literature as frailty effects or in the vaccine literature as depletion-of-susceptibles bias (5\u20138). The issue is that a study with higherand lower-risk participants (in other words, risk heterogeneity) can create an illusion of waning vaccine efficacy (VE) over time even when the effect of the vaccine on each individual is not changing, or it can exaggerate the estimated magnitude of true individual waning VE. Vaccine efficacy is defined as the percentage reduction in disease incidence among a vaccinated group compared with an unvaccinated group over a specified time period. It is typically measured in 2 previously uninfected populations: one newly vaccinated and the other not (the control population). Randomization at baseline is used to balance the risk factors for future infection. As an example, if 10% of a control group and 7% of a vaccinated group get the disease over 10 months of follow-up, the VE over the 10-month period is 30% (1% 7%/10%). A complexity arises when we want to evaluate how VE changes over time, such as comparing efficacy for the first 5 months compared with the second 5months. When measuring VE at different time periods since vaccination, we typically exclude participants who have gotten the disease in earlier time periods in our calculations, because we want to estimate the vaccine's effect on people who have not yet experienced the disease within the study. A complicating issue is that people differ in immune functionality (some individuals are more frail and have a less robust immune system) and exposure risk (for example, some individuals may have high risk, such as health care workers or nursing home residents). Randomization creates 2 populations (vaccine and control) with the same proportions of frail and/or high-risk individuals at the start of the studies but, if the vaccine works, in the later periods there will be lower proportions of frail/high-risk individuals left in the control group who did not have the disease in early periods. Consider a simple example in the Figure, based on a model with 2 types of individuals: low-risk individuals and high-risk individuals\u2014where the risk for disease is 4 times greater for the high-risk group. In the example, an individual's VE is about 75% regardless of risk group or period. At randomization, the control and vaccine groups have equal proportions of high-risk participants, so the early population VE estimate is 75%, and it is just the average of individual VEs. But in the late period, many fewer high-risk participants are in the control group, because they did not make it disease-free to the late period. Unlike the start of the study, we are now comparing \u201capples,\u201d or higher-risk vaccine recipients, to \u201coranges,\u201d or lower-risk control participants. Thus, a smaller proportion of control participants get the disease in the later period. The late period population VE estimate is 62%. The individual VE has not changed over time, and the only difference between the early and late periods is the increased proportion of low-risk people in the control group. This can happen in big studies, too; if each figure in the graph represented 1000 people, the differences in population VE from early to late periods remain. The problem should not markedly affect a study with a low percentage of events (for example, Polack and colleagues [9] had an event rate of <0.5% for the initial VE estimates) because few people get the disease in the early period of the study. For large real-world observational studies, the problemmay be more severe because the risk groups are not balanced between unvaccinated and vaccinated participants. A solution for the heterogeneity problem is to account for the variability of risk in the modeling (see, for example, Hern\u00e1n and Robins [10]). For the simple example, we could calculate separate VEs for the low-risk populations and the high-risk populations. But accurately identifying Figure. Example of heterogeneity of risk affecting population VE, whereas an individual's VE remains constant across time.",

In light of reports of waning protection occurring 6 months after the primary two-dose vaccine series, data are needed on the safety and efficacy of offering a third (booster) dose in persons 16 years of age or older. Methods In this ongoing, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase 3 trial, we assigned participants who had received two 30-\u03bcg doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine at least 6 months earlier to be injected with a third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine or with placebo. We assessed vaccine safety and efficacy against Covid-19 starting 7 days after the third dose. Results A total of 5081 participants received a third BNT162b2 dose and 5044 received placebo. The median interval between dose 2 and dose 3 was 10.8 months in the vaccine group and 10.7 months in the placebo group; the median follow-up was 2.5 months. Local and systemic reactogenicity events from the third dose were generally of low grade. No new safety signals were identified, and no cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported. Among the participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection who could be evaluated, Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after dose 3 was observed in 6 participants in the vaccine group and in 123 participants in the placebo group, which corresponded to a relative vaccine efficacy of 95.3% (95% confidence interval, 89.5 to 98.3). Conclusions A third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine administered a median of 10.8 months after the second dose provided 95.3% efficacy against Covid-19 as compared with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine during a median follow-up of 2.5 months.

Methods- The randomized Phase-1/2 trial followed by a Phase-2 trial was carried out to assess safety and immunogenicity of different formulation of COVID-19 vaccine (Corbevax) and select an optimum formulation for a phase 3 study. Healthy adults without a history of Covid-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection, were enrolled. Findings- Low incidence of AEs were reported post vaccination of different Corbevax formulations and majority were mild in nature and no Grade-3 or serious AEs were observed. All formulations in Phase-1/2 study showed similar profile of humoral and cellular immune-response with higher response associated with increasing CpG1018 adjuvant content at same RBD protein content. Hence, high concentration of CpG1018 was tested in phase-2 study, which showed significant improvement in immune-responses in terms of anti-RBD-IgG concentrations, anti-RBD-IgG1 titers, nAb-titers and cellular immune-responses while maintaining the safety profile. Interestingly, binding and neutralizing antibody titers were persisted consistently till 6 months post second vaccine dose. Interpretations- Corbevax was well tolerated with no observed safety concerns. Neutralizing antibody titers were suggestive of high vaccine effectiveness compared with human convalescent plasma or protective thresholds observed during vaccine efficacy trials of other COVID-19 vaccines. The study was prospectively registered with clinical trial registry of India- CTRI/2021/06/034014 and CTRI/2020/11/029032.

Here, we examined the waning of antibody responses against different variants following primary and booster vaccination. We found that antibody responses against variants were low following primary vaccination. The antibody response against Omicron was almost non-existent. Efficient boosting of antibody response against all variants, including Omicron, was observed following a third dose. The antibody response against the variants tested was significantly higher at one month following booster vaccination, compared with two months following primary vaccination, for all individuals, including the low antibody responders identified at two months following primary vaccination. The antibody response, for all variants tested, was significantly higher at four months post booster than at five months post primary vaccination, and the proportion of low responders remained low (6-11%). However, there was significant waning of antibody response in more than 95% of individuals at four months, compared to one month following booster. We also observed a robust memory B cell response following booster, which remained higher at four months post booster than prior to booster. However, the memory B cell responses were on the decline for 50% of individuals at four months following booster. Similarly, while the T cell response is sustained, at cohort level, at four months post booster, a substantial proportion of individuals (18.8 \u2013 53.8%) exhibited T cell response at four months post booster that has waned to levels below their corresponding levels before booster. The findings show an efficient induction of immune response against SARS-CoV-2 variants following booster vaccination. However, the induced immunity by the third BNT162b2 vaccine dose was transient. The findings suggest that elderly individuals may require a fourth dose to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.",

However, the relationship between time since vaccination and protection is unclear.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTime-varying vaccine efficacy (VE[t]) was examined in healthy adult participants (age range, 18-49 years) in a placebo-controlled trial of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) performed during the 2007-2008 influenza season. Symptomatic respiratory illnesses were laboratory-confirmed as influenza. VE(t) was estimated by fitting a smooth function based on residuals from Cox proportional hazards models. Subjects had blood samples collected immediately prior to vaccination, 30 days after vaccination, and at the end of the influenza season for testing by hemagglutination inhibition and neuraminidase inhibition assays.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall efficacy was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50%-82%) for IIV and 38% (95% CI, 5%-59%) for LAIV. Statistically significant waning was detected for IIV (P = .03) but not LAIV (P = .37); however, IIV remained significantly efficacious until data became sparse at the end of the season. Similarly, antibody titers against influenza virus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase significantly decreased over the season among IIV recipients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBoth vaccines were efficacious but LAIV less so. IIV efficacy decreased slowly over time, but the vaccine remained significantly efficacious for the majority of the season.",

Efficacy of a heterologous boosting using one dose of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 fusion protein vaccine (V-01) in inactivated vaccine-primed population was studied, aimed to restore the immunity. A randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled phase III trial was conducted in healthy people aged 18 years or older in Pakistan and Malaysia. Each eligible participant received one dose of the V-01 vaccine developed by Livzon Mabpharm Inc. or placebo within the 3-6 months after the two-dose primary regimen, and was monitored for safety and efficacy. The primary endpoint was protection against confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 10,218 participants were randomly assigned to receive a vaccine or placebo. Virus-neutralizing antibodies were assessed in 419 participants. A dramatic increase (11.3-fold; 128.3\u20131452.8) of neutralizing titres was measured in the V-01 group at 14 days after the booster. Over two months of surveillance, vaccine efficacy was 47.8% (95%CI: 22.6\u201364.7) according to the intention-to-treat principle. The most common adverse events were transient, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fever, headache, and fatigue. Serious adverse events occurred almost equally in V-01 (0.12%) and placebo (0.16%) groups. The heterologous boosting with the V-01 vaccine was safe and efficacious, which could elicit robust humoral immunity under the epidemic of the Omicron variant.

NEJM 2021). Herein we aimed to explore the long-term efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccination among pts with genitourinary cancer. Methods: In this study, pts with genitourinary malignancies (prostate, kidney, and bladder cancers) who had not received COVID-19 vaccination were included. Blood samples were collected prior to and after one dose of either an adenovirus- or mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine at the 2- and 6-month timepoints. Additional blood samples from pts receiving systemic treatment were collected at 3 consecutive therapy cycles following vaccination. Antibody titers were assessed using the SCoV-2 Detect IgG ELISA assay and results were reported as immune status ratios (ISR). T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing was performed using the MiXCR software (MiLabs) and custom strips were used to assess TCR abundance and homology clustering. Results: A total of 183 pts were enrolled, and 136 pts provided baseline blood samples. Among these, 59 (8:51 F:M) provided samples for both the 2- and 6-month timepoints by the 10/6/2021 data cut-off. In this subset of pts, median age was 66 (range 48-85) and 33 (55.9%), 25 (42.4%), and 1 (1.7%) pts had prostate, kidney, and bladder cancer, respectively. A majority of the pts (93.2%) were on systemic treatment with 23.7% on immune checkpoint inhibitors, 18.6% on targeted agents, and 1.7% on chemotherapy. The most commonly administered vaccines were BNT162b2 (61.0%) followed by mRNA-1273 (37.3%) and Ad26.COV2.S (1.7%). The mean (\u00b1standard deviation) ISR values at baseline and 2 months were 0.68\u00b11.59 and 6.62\u00b11.75, respectively. At the 6-month timepoint, mean ISR was 5.46\u00b11.61; this was significantly lower than the 2-month antibody titers (p < 0.0001), and reflects a reduction of 17.6%. Further data on TCR sequencing will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first data assessing the long-term serologic outcomes of COVID-19 vaccination in pts with cancer. Our data suggest waning immunity over time in cancer pts. Strategies to prolong host immunity against SARS COV-2 (e.g., booster vaccination) are likely warranted.",

The efficacy and longevity of vaccine protection, however, is still in question. Methods: In this prospective observational study we assessed immunogenicity of cancers patients on active treatment for solid cancers in two Slovenian Oncology Centres receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG antibodies in serum; before, after first and second dose, 3 and 6 months (mo) after complete primary course of vaccination and 1 mo after the 3rd booster dose. Samples with \u2265 175 ng/ml were considered positive. Results: There were 125 pts included in the study, 112 completed the primary course of vaccination with 2 vaccine doses and 34 received the booster 3rd dose. Out of 34 pts receiving booster 3rd dose, the majority received mRNA based vaccines (88%) for the primary course of vaccination and all patients received mRNA based vaccines for the booster 3rd dose. Median time from 2nd to booster 3rd dose of vaccine was 6.75 mo, median age of pts was 66 yrs and 59% were male. Patients were receiving chemotherapy (ChT), immune checkpoint inhibitors (IO) or targeted therapy (TT) in 9%, 56% and 35%, respectively. They achieved seroconversion in 94% after the 2nd and in 97% after the 3rd booster dose. Overall, the median anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG titer was 11,191 ng/ml (mean 25,394; range 0 \u2013 100,000) after complete primary course of vaccination and 1892 ng/ml (mean 6413; range 0 \u2013 72,000) 6 mo after, P < 0.0001. However anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG antibodies increased significantly after the 3rd booster dose with median antibody value 51,310 ng/ml (mean 51,787; range 0 \u2013 100,000), P < 0.001. Only one pt in this group got infected with SARS-CoV-2 and had a mild disease course. Conclusions: Cancer pts treated for solid malignancies achieve a high rate of seroconversion through the primary course of vaccination. However, significant waning of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is observed 6 months thereafter, which can be potentiated with additional 3rd booster dose of vaccine.",

The aim of this population-based cross-sectional study was to investigate the level of reported compliance with home isolation among the adult Israeli population (n = 940) during the first three national lockdowns, compliance with a potential fourth national lockdown if enacted, risk perception of COVID-19, vaccination uptake status, perceived effectiveness of the vaccine, and compliance with additional protective health behaviors (e.g., mask wearing and social distancing). Following widespread compliance with initial lockdowns (90.7% reported \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cvery high\u201d compliance), as few as 60.1% of participants indicated that they would comply with a fourth lockdown if the government decides to enact it. Non-vaccinated individuals reported the lowest levels of compliance with previous lockdowns, compared to participants who received one or two vaccines and participants vaccinated with three doses. Adjusted for gender and age, the results suggest that fearing being infected with COVID-19, perceiving the vaccine to be effective, and reporting being compliant with other health behaviors\u2014such as mask wearing and maintaining social distance from others\u2014are predictors of lockdown compliance. Considering the effect of pandemic lockdown fatigue, there is little support for additional lockdowns among the Israeli public, unless dramatic changes occur in the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compliance with lockdowns is reduced among individuals who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19, therefore rendering this non-pharmaceutical intervention even less effective in reducing the spread of the disease.",

Trials of vaccine candidates using mRNA delivery systems developed by Pfizer\u2010BioNTech and Moderna have shown substantial VEs of 94\u201395%, leading the US Food and Drug Administration to issue Emergency Use Authorizations and subsequent widespread administration of the vaccines. As the trials continue, a key issue is the possibility that VE may wane over time. Ethical considerations dictate that trial participants be unblinded and those randomized to placebo be offered study vaccine, leading to trial protocol amendments specifying unblinding strategies. Crossover of placebo subjects to vaccine complicates inference on waning of VE. We focus on the particular features of the Moderna trial and propose a statistical framework based on a potential outcomes formulation within which we develop methods for inference on potential waning of VE over time and estimation of VE at any postvaccination time. The framework clarifies assumptions made regarding individual\u2010 and population\u2010level phenomena and acknowledges the possibility that subjects who are more or less likely to become infected may be crossed over to vaccine differentially over time. The principles of the framework can be adapted straightforwardly to other trials.",

The most recent variant is Omicron (line B.1.1.529), which was first identified in South Africa in November 2021. The concern with this variant is the ineffectiveness of vaccines currently available. We aim to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines and boosters for the Omicron variant. Methods We searched the PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases from inception to June 5th, 2022. Studies that examined the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines against the Omicron variant infection were included. Random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant. Results A total of 13 studies were included to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine against the Omicron variant, and 11 studies were included to compare the effectiveness between the two-dose and three-dose (booster) vaccinations. Full vaccination (two-dose with or without booster) showed a protective effect against the Omicron variant compared to no vaccination (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.56\u20130.69), while the effectiveness decreased significantly over 6 months after the last dose. The two-dose vaccination plus booster provided better protection against the Omicron variant compared to the two-dose vaccination without booster (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.52\u20130.68). Additional analysis was performed for the most commonly used vaccines in the United Staes: BNT162b2(Pfizer) (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.52\u20130.82) and mRNA-1273(Moderna) (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.58\u20130.88) vaccines in the US, which showed similar effectiveness compared to no vaccination. Conclusions The full dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination effectively reduces infection from the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant; however, the effectiveness wanes over time. The booster vaccine provides additional protection against the Omicron variant.",

It is more difficult to evaluate VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection than against symptomatic COVID-19 because infection is not observed directly but rather is known to occur between two antibody or RT-PCR tests. Additional challenges arise as community transmission changes over time and as participants are vaccinated on different dates because of staggered enrollment or crossover before the end of the study. Here, we provide valid and efficient statistical methods for estimating potentially waning VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection with blood or nasal samples under time-varying community transmission, staggered enrollment, and blinded or unblinded crossover. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods through numerical studies mimicking the BNT162b2 phase 3 trial and the Prevent COVID U study. In addition, we assess how crossover and the frequency of diagnostic tests affect the precision of VE estimates.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies using data accrued from global SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efforts have demonstrated that breakthrough infections are correlated with levels of neutralizing antibodies. The decrease in neutralizing antibody titers of vaccinated individuals over time, combined with the emergence of more infectious variants of concern has resulted in waning vaccine efficacy against infection and a rise in breakthrough infections. Here we use a combination of neutralizing antibody measurements determined by a high throughput surrogate viral neutralization test (sVNT) together with published data from vaccine clinical trials and comparative plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) between SARS-CoV-2 variants to develop a model for vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic infection. Vaccine efficacy estimates using this model show good concordance with real world data from the US and Israel. Our work demonstrates that appropriately calibrated neutralizing antibody measurements determined by high throughput sVNT can be used to provide a semi-quantitative estimate of protection against infection. Given the highly variable antibody levels among the vaccinated population, this model may be of use in identification of individuals with an elevated risk of breakthrough infections.",
