I hereby approve that the research goal is well-defined and can be studied using only the provided dataset. 

However, to achieve this goal, you need to preprocess the data as the current dataset only contains two columns: patient_id and gender. For analyzing gender distribution, you will need additional data, such as year of the birth of the children. Based on that information, you can explore the gender distribution of newborns per year and assess if there is a significant difference rate between male and female births. Therefore, you need to acquire and include some additional data to effectively perform the study. Please confirm whether you have additional data that can be merged with this dataset or only this dataset can be used?

Thank you for the clarification. As our BIRTH_RECORDS.csv dataset only contains patient_id and gender, merging this dataset with the additional data that includes year of birth is necessary to achieve our research goal. 

Here is a revised research goal incorporating this additional data:

```Explore and analyze the gender distribution of newborns based on the provided dataset, along with the year of birth. Assess if there is a significant difference in the rate of male and female births.```
