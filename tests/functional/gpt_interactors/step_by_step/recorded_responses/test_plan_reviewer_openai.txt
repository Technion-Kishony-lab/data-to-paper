Sure, here is a short data analysis plan for testing gender bias in the birth records data:

1. Load the dataset "BIRTH_RECORDS.csv".
2. Examine the data for any missing or erroneous values and clean the data if necessary.
3. Check the distribution of gender in the dataset.
4. Calculate the proportion of male and female births.
5. Create a hypothesis stating that there is or is not a gender bias in the birth records. 
6. Select an appropriate statistical test to evaluate the hypothesis, such as a chi-square test or a t-test.
7. Conduct the statistical test and examine the resulting p-value.
8. Based on the analysis, make a conclusion regarding the presence or absence of gender bias in the birth records. 
9. Report the findings with appropriate statistical measures and visualizations, as well as any limitations or assumptions of the analysis.
