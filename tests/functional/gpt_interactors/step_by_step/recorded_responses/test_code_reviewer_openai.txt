Sure, here is the code: 

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# load data
data = pd.read_csv('BIRTH_RECORDS.csv')

# calculate gender ratio
gender_counts = data['gender'].value_counts()
fract_female = gender_counts.loc['F'] / gender_counts.sum()

# compare to 50% using chi-squared test
expected = [0.5, 0.5]
observed = [fract_female, 1 - fract_female]
chi_sq, p_value, dof, _ = chi2_contingency([expected, observed])

# write results to text file
result_str = "Gender ratio: {:.2%}\n".format(fract_female)
result_str += "Chi-squared test statistic: {:.2f}\n".format(chi_sq)
result_str += "p-value: {:.4f}\n".format(p_value)
result_str += "Degrees of freedom: {}\n".format(dof)

with open('results.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(result_str)
```
This code will load the data from the given csv file, calculate the gender ratio, compare it with 50% using a chi-squared test, and save the results to a text file named `results.txt`. The output file will include the gender ratio, chi-squared test statistic, p-value, and degrees of freedom.

I apologize for the mistake in my previous code. Here is an updated code that should work:

n_females = data['gender'].value_counts().F
n_males = data['gender'].value_counts().M

p_females = n_females / (n_females + n_males)
p_males = n_males / (n_females + n_males)

d = {'Females': [n_females, p_females], 
     'Males': [n_males, p_males]}
df = pd.DataFrame(d, index=['n', 'p'])

# calculate gender ratio and expected values
total = df.loc['n'].sum()
expected_ratio = 0.5
expected_females = total * expected_ratio
expected_males = total * (1 - expected_ratio)

# perform chi-squared test
observed = np.array([n_females, n_males])
expected = np.array([expected_females, expected_males])
chi2, p, dof, _ = chi2_contingency([observed, expected])

# save results to file

    f.write(f"Chi-squared statistic: {chi2}\n")
    f.write(f"p-value: {p}\n")
    f.write(f"Degrees of freedom: {dof}\n")
```

This code reads in the given csv file and calculates the number and ratio of females and males in the dataset. Then, it calculates the expected number of females and males assuming no bias towards either gender. The code then performs a chi-squared test to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the observed and expected values. Finally, the results are saved to a text file named `results.txt`.

# Write results to file
with open("results.txt", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write("Gender ratio:\n{}\n".format(gender_ratio))
    outfile.write("Deviation from expected gender ratio (50%): {}\n".format(deviation_from_expected))
```

This code reads in the `BIRTH_RECORDS.csv` file using the `pandas` library. It then calculates the gender ratio and compares it to the expected value of 50%. Finally, the results are written to the `results.txt` file using the `open` function and the `write` method.

Please make sure that the `BIRTH_RECORDS.csv` file is located in the same directory as the Python code and that the file name is spelled correctly.

My apologies for the confusion. The error message suggests that the code is unable to find the `BIRTH_RECORDS.csv` file in the current working directory. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that the `BIRTH_RECORDS.csv` file is located in the same directory as the Python code that you are running. You can check the file path using the `os` module in Python. For example, you can add the following line at the beginning of your code:

```python
import os
print(os.getcwd())
```

This will print the current working directory of your Python code, which should contain the `BIRTH_RECORDS.csv` file.

2. Double-check that the file name is spelled correctly in your code. If the file name is incorrect, the code will not be able to find the file.

3. If the issue persists, you can try specifying the full file path instead of just the file name in your code. For example, if the `BIRTH_RECORDS.csv` file is located in the `/home/user/data` directory, you can change the file read line to the following:

```python
data = pd.read_csv("/home/user/data/BIRTH_RECORDS.csv", skipinitialspace=True)
```

Please let me know if any of these solutions worked for you.

Here's the code to perform the data analysis plan you have provided:

``` python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

df = pd.read_csv('BIRTH_RECORDS.csv')

total_births = len(df)
total_female_births = len(df[df['gender'] == 'F'])
total_male_births = len(df[df['gender'] == 'M'])

gender_ratio = total_female_births / total_births
expected_ratio = 0.5

results = {}
results['gender_ratio'] = gender_ratio
results['expected_ratio'] = expected_ratio

# perform chi-square test to test for significant difference from expected ratio
observed = np.array([[total_female_births, total_male_births]])
expected = np.array([[total_births * expected_ratio, total_births * (1 - expected_ratio)]])
_, p_value, _, _ = chi2_contingency(observed, expected)
results['p_value'] = p_value

# write results to a file
with open('results.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Gender Ratio = {}\n'.format(gender_ratio))
    file.write('Expected Ratio = {}\n'.format(expected_ratio))
    file.write('P-value = {}'.format(p_value))
```

This code reads in the 'BIRTH_RECORDS.csv' file and calculates the total number of births, total number of female births and total number of male births. It then calculates the gender ratio and expected ratio. The code then performs a chi-square test to check if the gender ratio is significantly different from the expected ratio and saves the p-value in the results dictionary. Finally, the results are written to the 'results.txt' file.

Note: This code assumes that the 'BIRTH_RECORDS.csv' file has a header row. If the file does not have a header row, you can add the parameter "header=None" to the pd.read_csv function call.
<<<<<END

I apologize for that. Here is the modified code that takes into account that the data and the code files are located in the same directory:

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# get the path of the current directory and add the filename to it
dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
filename = 'BIRTH_RECORDS.csv'
full_path = os.path.join(dir_path, filename)

df = pd.read_csv(full_path)

total_births = len(df)
total_female_births = len(df[df['gender'] == 'F'])
total_male_births = len(df[df['gender'] == 'M'])

gender_ratio = total_female_births / total_births
expected_ratio = 0.5

results = {}
results['gender_ratio'] = gender_ratio
results['expected_ratio'] = expected_ratio

# perform chi-square test to test for significant difference from expected ratio
observed = np.array([[total_female_births, total_male_births]])
expected = np.array([[total_births * expected_ratio, total_births * (1 - expected_ratio)]])
_, p_value, _, _ = chi2_contingency(observed, expected)
results['p_value'] = p_value

# write results to a file
with open('results.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Gender Ratio = {}\n'.format(gender_ratio))
    file.write('Expected Ratio = {}\n'.format(expected_ratio))
    file.write('P-value = {}'.format(p_value))
```

This code first gets the path of the current directory using os module. It then concatenates the filename 'BIRTH_RECORDS.csv' to get the full file path. After that, it reads the file and proceeds to the same analysis step as the previous code. Finally, the code writes the results to results.txt file.

I'm sorry about that. Here is the modified code without the os module:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

df = pd.read_csv('BIRTH_RECORDS.csv')

total_births = len(df)
total_female_births = len(df[df['gender'] == 'F'])
total_male_births = len(df[df['gender'] == 'M'])

gender_ratio = total_female_births / total_births
expected_ratio = 0.5

results = {}
results['gender_ratio'] = gender_ratio
results['expected_ratio'] = expected_ratio

# perform chi-square test to test for significant difference from expected ratio
observed = np.array([[total_female_births, total_male_births]])
expected = np.array([[total_births * expected_ratio, total_births * (1 - expected_ratio)]])

    file.write('Gender Ratio = {}\n'.format(gender_ratio))
    file.write('Expected Ratio = {}\n'.format(expected_ratio))
    file.write('P-value = {}'.format(p_value))
```

This code does not import the `os` module anymore. Instead, it reads the 'BIRTH_RECORDS.csv' file directly from the current working directory. The rest of the code is the same as before.
