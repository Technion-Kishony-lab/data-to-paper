        * Any other relevant statistical issues.

        - Hypotheses.
        The keys of this dictionary should briefly describe each of our hypotheses.
        The values of this dictionary \t 
        should specify the most adequate statistical test for each hypothesis, \t
        and describe how it should be performed while accounting for any issues you have outlined above.

        For each of our hypotheses, suggest a *single* statistical test.
        If there are several possible ways to test a given hypothesis, specify only *one* statistical test \t
        (the simplest one).

        Example:

        ```python

                'Missing data points': 'Based on the {codes_and_outputs:data_exploration}, \t

                "xxx is associated with yyy and zzz":
                    "Linear regression with xxx as the independent variable and \t
        yyy and zzz as the dependent variables while adjusting for aaa, bbb, ccc",
                "The association between xxx and yyy is moderated by zzz":

        while adding the interaction term between yyy and zzz",

        These of course are just examples. Your actual response should be based on the \t
