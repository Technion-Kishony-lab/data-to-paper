        Use the following guidelines when writing the Results:

        * Include 3-4 paragraphs, each focusing on one of the Tables:
        You should typically have a separate paragraph describing each of the Tables. \t
        In each such paragraph, indicate the motivation/question for the analysis, the methodology, \t
        and only then describe the results. You should refer to the Tables by their labels (using \\ref{table:xxx}) \t
        and explain their content, but do not add the tables themselves (I will add the tables later manually).

        * Story-like flow: 
        It is often nice to have a story-like flow between the paragraphs, so that the reader \t
        can follow the analysis process with emphasis on the reasoning/motivation behind each analysis step. 
        For example, the first sentence of each paragraph can be a story-guiding sentences like: 
        "First, to understand whether xxx, we conducted a simple analysis of ..."; "Then, to test yyy, we performed a \t
        ..."; "Finally, to further verify the effect of zzz, we tested whether ...".

        * Conclude with a summary of the results:
        You can summarize the results at the end, with a sentence like: "In summary, these results show ...", \t
        or "Taken together, these results suggest ...".
        IMPORTANT NOTE: Your summary SHOULD NOT include a discussion of conclusions, implications, limitations, \t
        or of future work. \t
        (These will be added later as part the Discussion section, not the Results section).

    numeric_values_instructions: str = dedent_triple_quote_str("""
        * Numeric values:

        - Sources: 
        You can extract numeric values from the above provided sources: "{latex_tables_linked}", \t
        "{additional_results_linked}", and "{data_file_descriptions_no_headers_linked}".
        All numeric values in these sources have a \\hypertarget with a unique label. 

        - Cited numeric values should be formatted as \\hyperlink{<label>}{<value>}:
        Any numeric value extracted from the above sources should be written with a proper \\hyperlink to its \t
        corresponding source \\hypertarget.

        - Dependent values should be calculated using the \\num command.
        In scientific writing, we often need to report values which are not explicitly provided in the sources, \t
        but can rather be derived from them. For example: changing units, \t
        calculating differences, transforming regression coefficients into odds ratios, etc (see examples below).

        To derive such dependent values, please use the \\num{<formula>, "explanation"} command. 
        The <formula> contains a calculation, which will be automatically replaced with its result upon pdf compilation. 
        The "explanation" is a short textual explanation of the calculation \t
        (it will not be displayed directly in the text, but will be useful for review and traceability).  

        - Toy example for citing and calculating numeric values:

        Suppose our provided source data includes:
        ```
        No-treatment response: \\hypertarget{Z1a}{0.65} 
        With-treatment response: \\hypertarget{Z2a}{0.87}

        Treatment regression: 
        coef = \\hypertarget{Z3a}{0.17}, STD = \\hypertarget{Z3b}{0.072}, pvalue = <\\hypertarget{Z3c}{1e-6}
        ```

        Then, here are some examples of proper ways to report these provided source values:
        ```
        The no-treatment control group had a response of \\hyperlink{Z1a}{0.65} while the with-treatment \t
        group had a response of \\hyperlink{Z2a}{0.87}.

        The regression coefficient for the treatment was \\hyperlink{Z3a}{0.17} with a standard deviation of \t
        \\hyperlink{Z3b}{0.072} (P-value: < \\hyperlink{Z3c}{1e-6}).
        ```

        And here are some examples of proper ways to calculate dependent values, using the \\num command:
        ```
        The difference in response was \\num{\\hyperlink{Z2a}{0.87} - \\hyperlink{Z1a}{0.65}, \t
        "Difference between responses with and without treatment"}.

        The treatment odds ratio was \t
        \\num{exp(\\hyperlink{Z3a}{0.17}), \t
        "Translating the treatment regression coefficient to odds ratio"} (CI: \t 
        \\num{exp(\\hyperlink{Z3a}{0.17} - 1.96 * \\hyperlink{Z3b}{0.072}), \t
        "low CI for treatment odds ratio, assuming normality"}, \t
        \\num{exp(\\hyperlink{Z3a}{0.17} + 1.96 * \\hyperlink{Z3b}{0.072}), \t
        "high CI for treatment odds ratio, assuming normality"}).
        ```

        * Accuracy: 
        Make sure that you are only mentioning details that are explicitly found within the Tables and \t
        Numerical Values.

        * Unknown values:
        If we need to include a numeric value that is not explicitly given in the \t
        Tables or "{additional_results_linked}", and cannot be derived from them using the \\num command, \t
        then indicate `[unknown]` instead of the numeric value. 

        For example:
        ```
        The no-treatment response was \\hyperlink{Z1a}{0.65} (STD: [unknown]).
        ```
