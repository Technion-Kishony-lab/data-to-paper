# Description of the Dataset
## General Description
The dataset includes diabetes related factors extracted from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), year 2015.
The original BRFSS, from which this dataset is derived, is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC.
Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of
preventative services. These features are either questions directly asked of participants, or calculated variables based on individual participant
responses.

## Data Files
The dataset consists of 1 data file:

### "diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv"
The csv file is a clean dataset of 253,680 responses (rows) and 22 features (columns).
All rows with missing values were removed from the original dataset; the current file contains no missing values.

The columns in the dataset are:

#1 `Diabetes_binary`: (int, bool) Diabetes (0=no, 1=yes)
#2 `HighBP`: (int, bool) High Blood Pressure (0=no, 1=yes)
#3 `HighChol`: (int, bool) High Cholesterol (0=no, 1=yes)

#9 `PhysActivity`: (int, bool) Physical Activity in past 30 days (0=no, 1=yes)
#10 `Fruits`: (int, bool) Consume one fruit or more each day (0=no, 1=yes)
#11 `Veggies`: (int, bool) Consume one Vegetable or more each day (0=no, 1=yes)
#12 `HvyAlcoholConsump` (int, bool) Heavy drinkers (0=no, 1=yes)
#13 `AnyHealthcare` (int, bool) Have any kind of health care coverage (0=no, 1=yes)
#14 `NoDocbcCost` (int, bool) Was there a time in the past 12 months when you needed to see a doctor but could not because of cost? (0=no, 1=yes)
#15 `GenHlth` (int, ordinal) self-reported health (1=excellent, 2=very good, 3=good, 4=fair, 5=poor)
#16 `MentHlth` (int, ordinal) How many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good? (1 - 30 days)
#17 `PhysHlth` (int, ordinal) Hor how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good? (1 - 30 days)
#18 `DiffWalk` (int, bool) Do you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs? (0=no, 1=yes)

[5] ----- USER {DataExplorer} -> "Data Exploration Code"  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of a data-exploration phase, please write a complete short Python code for getting a first sense of the data.

Your code should create an output text file named "data_exploration.txt", which should contain a summary of the data.

The output file should be self-contained; any results you choose to save to this file should be accompanied with a short header.

The output file should be formatted as follows:


# Data Size
<Measure of the scale of our data (e.g., number of rows, number of columns)>

# Summary Statistics
<Summary statistics of all or key variables>

# Categorical Variables
<As applicable, list here categorical values and their most common values>

# Missing Values
<Counts of missing, unknown, or undefined values>
<As applicable, counts of special numeric values that stand for unknown/undefined if any (check in the "Description of the Dataset" above for any)>

# <title of other summary you deem relevant, if any>
<Add any other summary of the data you deem relevant>

# <etc for any other summary you deem relevant.>


If any of the above sections is not applicable, then write "# Not Applicable" under that section.

If needed, you can use the following packages which are already installed:
('pandas', 'numpy', 'scipy')

Do not provide a sketch or pseudocode; write a complete runnable code.
Do not create any graphics, figures or any plots.
Do not send any presumed output examples.

### Explanation:
1. **Loading the Data**: The data is read from the CSV file using `pd.read_csv()`.
2. **Writing to the File**: The text file "data_exploration.txt" is opened in write mode.
3. **Data Size**: The number of rows and columns of the dataset are written to the file.
4. **Summary Statistics**: The summary statistics for all columns of the dataset are generated using `data.describe()` and written to the file.
5. **Categorical Variables**: For the specified categorical variables ('Sex', 'Age', 'Education', and 'Income'), their value counts are written to the
file.
6. **Missing Values**: As per the description, there are no missing values in the dataset.
7. **Additional Summaries**: Just as an example, a correlation matrix for the dataset is generated and written to the file.

The output file "data_exploration.txt" will ensure that any results saved to it are accompanied by a short header, making it self-contained and easy
to understand.

\section{Code Explanation}

We performed an initial data exploration of the \texttt{diabetes\_binary\_health\_indicators\_BRFSS2015.csv} dataset to understand its structure and
basic characteristics. The dataset contains 253,680 responses and 22 features, which include a mix of binary, numerical, categorical, and ordinal
data.

\subsection{Data Size}
First, we determined the size of the dataset by recording the number of rows and columns. This provides an initial understanding of the dataset's
dimensionality, which is essential for subsequent analysis steps.

\subsection{Summary Statistics}
We generated summary statistics for all variables to gain insights into the central tendency and dispersion of the numerical features. The method
\texttt{data.describe()} was used to calculate measures such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. Summary statistics offer a
comprehensive overview of the dataset's numerical properties, aiding in the identification of potential patterns or anomalies.

\subsection{Categorical Variables}
The dataset includes several categorical variables, namely 'Sex', 'Age', 'Education', and 'Income.' For these variables, we computed and recorded the
counts of the top 5 most common values using the \texttt{value\_counts()} method. This step helps in understanding the distribution and prevalence of
different categories within these variables, which is crucial for further analysis and model-building exercises.

\subsection{Missing Values}
According to the dataset's description, there are no missing values present. This information was simply noted, affirming the completeness and quality
of the dataset.

\subsection{Correlation Matrix}
The correlation matrix for the dataset was computed using \texttt{data.corr()}. This matrix quantifies the strength and direction of the linear
relationships between continuous variables. Understanding correlations is vital for identifying collinear variables, which can impact the performance
of machine learning models and statistical analyses. It also aids in recognizing potential predictive variables for diabetes within the dataset.

Overall, this exploratory analysis provides a foundation for more in-depth statistical and machine learning analyses by highlighting key
characteristics and relationships within the data.
