The dataset contains 253,680 responses and 22 features, which include a mix of binary, numerical, categorical, and ordinal data.\n\n\\subsection{Data Size}\nFirst, we determined the size of the dataset by recording the number of rows and columns. This provides an initial understanding of the dataset's dimensionality, which is essential for subsequent analysis steps. \n\n\\subsection{Summary Statistics}\nWe generated summary statistics for all variables to gain insights into the central tendency and dispersion of the numerical features. The method \\texttt{data.describe()} was used to calculate measures such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. Summary statistics offer a comprehensive overview of the dataset's numerical properties, aiding in the identification of potential patterns or anomalies.\n\n\\subsection{Categorical Variables}\nThe dataset includes several categorical variables, namely 'Sex', 'Age', 'Education', and 'Income.' For these variables, we computed and recorded the counts of the top 5 most common values using the \\texttt{value\\_counts()} method. This step helps in understanding the distribution and prevalence of different categories within these variables, which is crucial for further analysis and model-building exercises.\n\n\\subsection{Missing Values}\nAccording to the dataset's description, there are no missing values present. This information was simply noted, affirming the completeness and quality of the dataset.\n\n\\subsection{Correlation Matrix}\nThe correlation matrix for the dataset was computed using \\texttt{data.corr()}. This matrix quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationships between continuous variables. Understanding correlations is vital for identifying collinear variables, which can impact the performance of machine learning models and statistical analyses. It also aids in recognizing potential predictive variables for diabetes within the dataset.\n\nOverall, this exploratory analysis provides a foundation for more in-depth statistical and machine learning analyses by highlighting key characteristics and relationships within the data.\n```"
