The CSV file contains a dataset with each row representing a result and each column representing a feature. The columns in the dataset are as follows:

"": Index number
"X": Index number
"condition": The doublet detection algorithm used to generate the AUPRC, AUROC, and TNR data (options include DoubletFinder, hybrid, scDblFinder, or Scrublet)
"dataset": The scRNA-seq dataset from which the data originated
"sample": The specific sample within the corresponding scRNA-seq dataset
"TNR": True negative rate
“dbl_exp”: Expected true doublet rate from 10X Genomics
"dbl_act": Actual true doublet rate from 10X Genomics
