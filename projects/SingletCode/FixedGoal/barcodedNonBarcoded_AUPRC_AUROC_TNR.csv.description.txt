The CSV file contains a dataset with each row representing a result and each column representing a feature. The columns in the dataset are as follows:

"": Index number
"X": Index number
"dataset": The scRNA-seq dataset from which the data originated
"sample": The specific sample within the corresponding scRNA-seq dataset from which the data originated
"condition": The doublet detection algorithm used to generate the AUPRC, AUROC, and TNR data (options include DoubletFinder, hybrid, scDblFinder, or Scrublet)
"auprc": Area under the precision-recall curve
"auroc": Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
"dbl_act": Actual true doublet rate of the dataset
"isBarcoded": Indicates whether barcoding technology was used in the dataset
"TNR": True negative rate
