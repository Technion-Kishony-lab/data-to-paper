The dataset includes results from various doublet detection algorithms applied to multiple scRNA-seq datasets with different doublet content and algorithm parameters. While scRNA-seq aims to measure the transcriptomes of individual cells, doublets can occur when two cells are captured as one. The purpose of doublet detection algorithms is to accurately identify these doublets so they can be removed for downstream analysis. The four algorithms evaluated are DoubletFinder, hybrid, scDblFinder, and Scrublet. Key performance metrics for these algorithms include the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and the true negative rate (TNR).
