## Statistical considerations:
### Confounding variables:
There are several potential confounding variables such as maternal age, gestational age, birth weight, and mode of delivery that should be accounted for in the statistical tests.
### Missing data points:
There is missing data in the columns "ProlongedRupture", "Chorioamnionitis", and "SNAPPE_II_SCORE". Depending on the extent of missing data, you may need to consider imputation or exclusion of these data points.
### Dependencies between data points:
Some variables may be dependent on each other, such as "EndotrachealSuction" and "MechanicalVentilation". Consider the dependencies in the analysis to avoid biased results.

## Hypotheses:
### Hypothesis:
Effect of NRP guideline change on EndotrachealSuction and MechanicalVentilation rates
### Test:
Chi-squared test of independence to examine the association between the PrePost variable (guideline change) and the rates of EndotrachealSuction and MechanicalVentilation, while considering potential confounders.

### Hypothesis:
Association between NRP guideline change and health outcomes (MeconiumAspirationSyndrome, RespiratoryDistressSyndrome, and Pneumothorax)
### Test:
Logistic regression models to assess the impact of the NRP guideline change on the occurrence of MeconiumAspirationSyndrome, RespiratoryDistressSyndrome, and Pneumothorax. Adjust for confounders and dependencies between data points.
