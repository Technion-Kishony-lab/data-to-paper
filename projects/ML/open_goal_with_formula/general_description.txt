Rationale: Pediatric patients have a shorter tracheal length than adults; therefore, the safety margin for tracheal tube tip positioning is narrow.
Indeed, the tracheal tube tip is misplaced in 35%â€“50% of pediatric patients and can cause hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, pneumothorax, and even death.
Therefore, in pediatric patients who require mechanical ventilation, it is crucial to determine the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (defined here as `OTTD`, not an official term).

Note: For brevity, we introduce the term `OTTD` to refer to the "optimal tracheal tube depth". This is not an official term that can be found in the literature.

Existing methods: The gold standard to determine OTTD is by chest X-ray, which is time-consuming and requires radiation exposure.
Alternatively, formula-based models on patient features such as age and height are used to determine OTTD, but with limited success.

Conventionally used formulas are:
- Height Formula-based Model: 
OTTD = height [cm] / 10 + 5 cm 

- Age Formula-based Model:
optimal tube depth is provided for each age group:
0 <= age [years] < 0.5: OTTD = 9 cm 
0.5 <= age [years] < 1: OTTD = 10 cm 
1 < age [years] < 2: OTTD = 11 cm 
2 < age [years]: OTTD = 12 cm + (age [years]) * 0.5 cm / year  

- ID Formula-based Model:
OTTD (in cm) = 3 * (tube ID [mm]) * cm/mm

The provided dataset focus on patients aged 0-7 year old who received post-operative mechanical ventilation after undergoing surgery at Samsung Medical Center between January 2015 and December 2018.
For each of these patients, the dataset provides the OTTD determined by chest X-ray as well as features extracted from patient electronic health records.
