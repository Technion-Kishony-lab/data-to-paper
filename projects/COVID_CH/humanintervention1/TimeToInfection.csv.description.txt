Data in the file "TimeToInfection.csv" is organized in time intervals, from day_interval_start to day_interval_stop. Missing data is shown as "" for not indicated or not relevant (e.g. which vaccine for the non-vaccinated group). It is very important to note, that per health worker (=ID number), several rows (time intervals) can exist, and the length of the intervals can vary (difference between day_interval_start and day_interval_stop). This can lead to biased results if not taken into account, e.g. when running a statistical comparison between two columns. It can also lead to biases when merging the two files, which therefore should be avoided. The file contains 16 columns:

ID	Unique Identifier of each health worker
group	Categorical, Vaccination group: "N" (no immunity), "V" (twice vaccinated, uninfected), "I" (infected, unvaccinated), "H" (hybrid: infected and ≥1 vaccination)
age	Continuous, age in years
sex	Categorical, female", "male" (or "" for not indicated)
BMI	Categorical, "o30" for over 30  or "u30" for below 30
patient_contact	Having contact with patients during work during this interval, 1=yes, 0=no
using_FFP2_mask	Always using protective respiratory masks during work, 1=yes, 0=no
negative_swab	documentation of ≥1 negative test in the previous month, 1=yes, 0=no
booster	receipt of booster vaccination, 1=yes, 0=no (or "" for not indicated)
positive_household	categorical, SARS-CoV-2 infection of a household contact within the same month, 1=yes, 0=no
months_since_immunisation	continuous, time since the last immunisation event (infection or vaccination) in months. Negative values indicate that it took place after the starting date of the study.
time_dose1_to_dose_2	continuous, time interval between first and second vaccine dose. Empty when not vaccinated twice
vaccinetype	Categorical, "Moderna" or "Pfizer_BioNTech" or "" for not vaccinated.
day_interval_start	day since start of study when the interval starts
day_interval_stop	day since start of study when the interval stops
infection_event	If an infection occurred during this time interval, 1=yes, 0=no
