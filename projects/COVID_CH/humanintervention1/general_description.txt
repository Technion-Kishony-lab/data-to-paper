General description 
In this prospective, multicentre cohort performed between August 2020 and March 2022, we recruited hospital employees from ten acute/nonacute healthcare networks in Eastern/Northern Switzerland, consisting of 2,595 participants (median follow-up 171 days). The study comprises infections with the delta and the omicron variant. We determined immune status in September 2021 based on serology and previous SARS-CoV-2 infections/vaccinations: Group N (no immunity); Group V (twice vaccinated, uninfected); Group I (infected, unvaccinated); Group H (hybrid: infected and â‰¥1 vaccination). Participants were asked to get tested for SARS-CoV-2 in case of compatible symptoms, according to national recommendations. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or rapid antigen diagnostic (RAD) test, depending on the participating institutions. The dataset is consisting of two files, one describing vaccination and infection events for all healthworkers, and the secone one describing the symptoms for the healthworkers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
