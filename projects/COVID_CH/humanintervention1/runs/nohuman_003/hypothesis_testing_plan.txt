## Statistical considerations:
### Missing data points:
There are missing values in important variables such as age and vaccination status, which need to be handled through imputation or exclusion of rows with missing data.
### Confounding variables:
Potential confounders like age, sex, and mask usage could influence the relationship between immunity status and reinfection risk or symptom count, and should be controlled for in the analysis.
### Dependencies between data points:
The presence of multiple rows per individual in the dataset may introduce dependencies between data points of the same health worker, which should be addressed to avoid biases.

## Hypotheses:
### Hypothesis:
H1: Healthcare workers with hybrid immunity have a lower risk of reinfection than those with only vaccination or infection
### Test:
Logistic regression to model the likelihood of reinfection (infection_event) as the outcome variable with Group (immunity status) as the main predictor. Control for potential confounding variables.

### Hypothesis:
H2: Healthcare workers with a recent booster shot have a lower number of symptoms after reinfection
### Test:
Independent samples t-test to compare the mean symptom count between healthcare workers with a recent booster shot (booster_over7_days_before=1) and those without (booster_over7_days_before=0). Adjust for confounding variables if necessary.

### Hypothesis:
H3: Regular usage of protective respiratory masks (FFP2) reduces the risk of reinfection
### Test:
Logistic regression to assess the effect of using_FFP2_mask on the likelihood of reinfection (infection_event). Account for potential confounders like age, sex, and group.
