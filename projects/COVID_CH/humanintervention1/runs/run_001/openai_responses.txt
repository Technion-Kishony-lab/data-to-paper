Amidst this evolving context, this study explores how prior infections and vaccinations affect symptom severity across different virus variants, addressing a critical gap in managing and forecasting pandemic trajectories. Utilizing a prospective, multicentre cohort of 2,595 healthcare workers from Switzerland, our analysis distinguished participants based on immunity status resulting from infection, vaccination, or their combination. We applied statistical models to evaluate the association of immunity status with symptom severity following infections mostly with the delta and omicron variants. Results underscored that vaccinated-only individuals generally exhibited fewer symptoms compared to those unvaccinated. However, symptom severity was not markedly different between hybrid-immunity and infected-only groups. The interaction between immunity types and variant types further nuanced these observations, with limited differences observed across variant types within immunity groups. Critically, the intervention of FFP2 masks was notably less prevalent among participants, attaching potential confounding to symptom severity assessment. These findings accentuate the nuanced role of hybrid immunity and vaccination in managing COVID-19 symptoms, pivotal for public health strategies and vaccine policy adaptations amidst variant evolution.\n\\end{abstract}\n```",

This study, conducted from August 2020 to March 2022, evaluates the influence of different immune statuses on the symptom severity of COVID-19 infections, crucial for tailoring pandemic management approaches. A dataset of 2,595 healthcare workers in Switzerland was analyzed, encompassing individuals categorized by immunity derived from vaccination, past infection, or a hybrid of both. By employing regression models, we quantified the relationship between these immune profiles and the symptom severity during infections predominantly caused by delta and omicron variants. Our findings reveal that typically, individuals with vaccination-only presented milder symptoms compared to unvaccinated individuals. The differences in symptom severity between the hybrid-immunity group and those only infected were minimal.

The study's implications are tempered by the minor use of FFP2 masks, which could skew symptom severity evaluations.

Despite extensive research on vaccine efficacy and infection outcomes, the specific associations between diverse immune profiles and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, especially among healthcare workers, remain inadequately quantified. This study leverages a cohort of 2,595 healthcare professionals in Switzerland, categorized by immunity type: vaccinated, previously infected, both (hybrid), or neither. We utilized regression analyses to assess how these immunity profiles correlated with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms during the delta and omicron variant surges. Our results illustrate that hybrid immunity typically resulted in the mildest symptomatology, whereas participants with no immunity experienced more severe symptoms. Notably, vaccination alone significantly reduced symptom severity compared to no immunity, with a minimal difference between hybrid and vaccinated-only groups. The interaction effects between immunity status and viral variants suggested minimal variability, implying a robustness of immune protection across different strain mutations. These findings are pivotal as they highlight the dynamics of immune responses in a real-world setting and carry substantial implications for vaccine deployment strategies and public health planning. However, a potential limitation is the uncontrolled use of personal protective equipment, such as FFP2 masks, which might influence exposure levels and consequently symptom severity assessments. This study's insights into immunity-driven variations in clinical outcomes can inform ongoing and future vaccine policy and outbreak preparedness.\n\\end{abstract}\n```",

Despite substantial investigations into immune responses to the virus, precise insights into how diverse immunity profiles affect the clinical presentation remain partially explored, particularly in frontline healthcare settings. This study scrutinizes a dataset comprising 2,595 healthcare workers from Switzerland, segregated by their immune status: vaccinated, infected, both (hybrid), or neither. Through multivariate regression models, we explored the associations between these immunity statuses and the symptom severity during predominant delta and omicron variant outbreaks. Our findings reveal that individuals with hybrid immunity report the least severe symptoms, while those devoid of any immunity endure the most severe manifestations. Vaccination alone substantially alleviates symptom severity relative to the absence of immunity. Interestingly, the additional benefit of hybrid immunity over vaccination alone appears marginal. We further identified that the interaction between immunity forms and virus variants showed limited influence on symptom outcomes, underscoring a consistent protective effect of established immunity across different viral strains. These findings underscore the importance of tailored vaccine and public health interventions based on detailed immune status analyses. Nonetheless, the variability in personal health behaviors and exposure risks among individuals could inherently affect the observed symptom severity, representing a limitation of this study.

The cohort included 2,595 participants, tracked over a median follow-up period of 171 days, during a study period between August 2020 and March 2022. Participants were chiefly categorized based on their immune status into four distinct groups: those without immunity, those vaccinated with two doses, those with infection-acquired immunity, and those with hybrid immunity, reflecting a combination of previous infection and vaccination. The dataset tracked intervals of potential infection exposure, with associated demographic and vaccination details, while a secondary file recorded the symptoms observed in workers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\nData were initially processed by removing entries lacking gender information, ensuring consistency across key categorical fields. Infection events, as recorded in the primary dataset, were identified and used to merge relevant data fields with corresponding records from the symptom dataset, where each affected individual appeared only once. This consolidated dataset then formed the basis for detailed statistical analysis, enabling direct linkage between immune status, variant exposure, and symptomatic responses for each healthcare worker.\n\n\\subsection{Data Analysis}\nStatistical analysis focused on understanding patterns and influences of immune status and SARS-CoV-2 variant on symptom severity, adjusted for confounding factors such as age, sex, and the presence of comorbidities. Initially, descriptive statistics were generated to elucidate the distribution of symptom numbers across different groups and variants among infected individuals. Subsequent analyses employed linear regression models to assess the impact of immune status and virus variant on symptom severity. The first model adjusted for demographic and health variables to estimate basic impacts, while the second model introduced an interaction term to explore how the combined effects of immune status and viral variant might differ. These models helped determine the extent to which symptoms varied among different immune profiles and under exposure to different viral strains.

To this end, we employed data from a comprehensive cohort of healthcare personnel and employed linear regression models to assess the impacts of immune status, virus variant, and their interactions on disease presentation \\cite{Tsanas2011NonlinearSA, Chun2014ImpactOV, Lang2023InfluenzaVB, Piccoli2020RiskAA, Schwappach2018SpeakUC}.\n\nOur results reveal a differential influence of immune statuses, with those possessing hybrid immunity reporting the least symptom severity, whereas individuals without any immunity endured the harshest manifestations \\cite{Goldberg2022ProtectionAW}. These findings echo prior evidence suggesting the high protection invoked by hybrid immunity and the increased disease severity in the absence of immunity \\cite{Hall2022ProtectionAS, Sen2021PredictingCS}. Interestingly, while vaccinations alone considerably reduced symptom severity, the additional benefit of hybrid immunity over vaccination alone appeared marginal, shedding light on the potential merits of broad-scale vaccination strategies.\n\nContrary to some recent concerns, our study found that the interaction powers of immunity forms and virus variants exhibited limited influence on symptom outcomes \\cite{Carabelli2023SARSCoV2VB, Lin2021TheDS}. This finding underscores a consistent protective effect of established immunity across different viral strains, challenging the notion that new variants might dramatically alter the effectiveness of immunity acquired from infection or vaccination \\cite{Harvey2021SARSCoV2VS, Carabelli2023SARSCoV2VB}. \n\nAlthough this study provides intriguing insights, it is not without limitations. While we paid careful attention to adjusting for demographic factors, certain other factors, such as personal health behaviors and varying exposure levels missed from our models, may potentially influence the reported result. Furthermore, our measurements were dependent on self-reported symptoms, which may introduce an element of bias, as more symptom-conscious individuals are likely overrepresented among healthcare workers.\n\nIn conclusion, we found robust evidence supporting the key role of immune status in modulating clinical outcomes upon exposure to major SARS-CoV-2 variants, with minimal interaction between immunity forms and virus variants. Given these findings, comprehensive tracking and categorization of individual immune statuses hold immense promise for personalizing public health responses and refining vaccination strategies. Future work to investigate how these relationships evolve with emerging variants and over longer periods will further illuminate the intricate dynamics between SARS-CoV-2 and human immunity, thus informing strategies for managing the ongoing pandemic and future outbreaks.\n```\n",

This population, while representing a highly exposed segment of the society, offered an intriguing perspective on the epidemiology of the disease, providing insights into the real-world effects of different immunity profiles and SARS-CoV-2 variants \\cite{Lang2023InfluenzaVB,Piccoli2020RiskAA,Schwappach2018SpeakUC}.\n\nOur findings illuminate an important variation in symptom severity with respect to diverse immunity profiles \\cite{Goldberg2022ProtectionAW}. While individuals with hybrid immunity reported fewer symptoms, those devoid of any immunity experienced the severest disease forms, thereby validating the global emphasis on achieving immunity either through vaccination or previous infection \\cite{Hall2022ProtectionAS, Sen2021PredictingCS}. Nonetheless, how immunity profiles could interact with different viral variants to influence clinical presentations remained relatively unchartered until our exploration. In this regard, we found that the anticipated variations in symptom severity with the change in viral strains were not significantly potentiated by immunity statuses. This observation contradicts some previous concerns regarding the compounding effects of variant type and immunity status on disease severity \\cite{Carabelli2023SARSCoV2VB, Lin2021TheDS}. Instead, our results advocate for a generalizable protective merit of vaccination and infection-conferred immunity across multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains \\cite{Harvey2021SARSCoV2VS, Carabelli2023SARSCoV2VB}.\n\nUnderstanding the limitations of this study is crucial for interpreting our findings. As our data depended on self-reported symptoms, potential biases stemming from over-or-under-reporting or misinterpretation of symptoms cannot be overlooked, especially given healthcare workers' heightened symptom awareness compared to the general population. Moreover, although our models adjusted for demographic and comorbidity factors, we did not factor in other potential confounders, such as personal health behaviors or varying exposure levels to SARS-CoV-2, which could have intrinsic impacts on symptom severity \\cite{Kim2020RiskFO}. Therefore, the possible influence of these unobserved factors on our results necessitates further investigations.\n\nIn conclusion, our study elucidated the significant role of individual immune statuses, independent of variant types, in modulating the clinical presentation of COVID-19. The consistency of this effect across major SARS-CoV-2 variants highlights the potential benefits of vaccination and acquired immunity regardless of variant types. While our results underline the limited additional benefit of hybrid immunity over vaccination alone, this insight elevates the critical role of broad-scale vaccination strategies, discouraging complacency in vaccination efforts even among previously infected individuals \\cite{Goldberg2022ProtectionAW}. These learnings open avenues for future inquiries exploring how variant-immunity interactions evolve over time and across emerging variants. Integrating such nuanced understanding of immune statuses can further enhance public health planning and implementation strategies, fostering robust resilience against current and future viral outbreaks.\n```",
