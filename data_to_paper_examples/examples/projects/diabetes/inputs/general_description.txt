The dataset includes diabetes related factors extracted from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), year 2015.
The original BRFSS, from which this dataset is derived, is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC.
Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventative services. These features are either questions directly asked of participants, or calculated variables based on individual participant responses.
