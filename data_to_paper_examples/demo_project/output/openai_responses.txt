    "Certainly! Here is the short Python code to find the largest prime number below a given natural number:\n\n```python\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_prime(num):\n    if num <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(np.sqrt(num)) + 1):\n        if (num % i) == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n\ndef find_largest_prime(num):\n    largest_prime = None\n    for i in range(num-1, 1, -1):\n        if is_prime(i):\n            largest_prime = i\n            break\n    return largest_prime\n    \n\n# Read the input number from file\nwith open(\"number.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    n = int(file.readline().split(\"=\")[1])\n\n# Find the largest prime number below n\nlargest_prime_number = find_largest_prime(n)\n\n# Write the result to output file\nwith open(\"prime_number.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n    file.write(f\"The largest prime number below {n} is {largest_prime_number}\")\n\n```\n\nMake sure the \"number.txt\" file is in the same directory as the Python code file.
